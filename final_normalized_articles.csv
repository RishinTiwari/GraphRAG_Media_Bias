WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, on Friday effectively took the side of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in his brutal invasion of Ukraine, calling visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy “disrespectful” and telling him he has “no cards” with which to negotiate.

“You’re either going to make a deal or we’re out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s going to be pretty,” Trump said, berating Zelenskyy in the Oval Office in front of gathered reporters.

Vance added: “I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media… You should be thanking the president for trying to bring you into this conference.”

Trump has been trying to coerce Zelenskyy into handing over Ukraine’s mineral rights in exchange for U.S. support, and the purpose of Zelenskyy’s visit was ostensibly to reach an agreement. Trump then told Zelenskyy that the Ukrainian leader was currently in no position to complain about the state of affairs, even though it was Putin, not Zelenskyy, who began the bloody three-year war.

“You don’t have the cards, but once we sign that deal, you’re in a much better position, but you’re not acting at all thankful. And that’s not a nice thing, I’ll be honest, that’s not a nice thing,” he said.

Trump and Vance’s insults of Zelenskyy came at the tail end of a nearly hour-long photo opportunity in which Trump invited questions. Trump grew visibly angry and ended media availability with: “I think we’ve seen enough.”

A planned joint news conference was canceled and Zelenskyy left the White House about an hour later. No agreement was signed.

By that point, Trump had already attacked Zelenskyy in a social media post:

“We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

Trump is trying to force Ukraine, which has been under a near-daily missile and drone barrage from Russia for three years, to turn over rare earth mineral deposits to the United States to pay for U.S. military aid the country was provided under former President Joe Biden.

The new efforts at coercion come six years after Trump’s first attempt to extort Ukraine, which had its origins in Trump’s choice to accept Russian help to win the 2016 election against Democrat Hillary Clinton.

During his discussion with Zelenskyy, Trump went off on a long tangent about the investigations into Putin helping Trump win the presidency in the first place in 2016. Although the details of Russian involvement were confirmed by both special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe and a separate inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee, Trump has lied that it was a “hoax.”

After sending his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to dig up evidence that Ukraine had tried to help Clinton in 2016, Trump attempted to extort the then-newly elected Zelenskyy into announcing an investigation into Biden, whom he most feared as an election opponent in 2020. Trump was impeached but not removed from office for that action.

Trump’s animosity toward Zelenskyy has clearly endured in the years since.

On Friday, Trump ranted about the investigations into Russia’s 2016 election interference in response to a question about how he could trust Putin to honor any peace agreement. Trump told reporters that Putin was similarly wronged by the investigations and then inexplicably dragged Biden’s son Hunter and California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff into his answer:

“Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him in ‘Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.’ You ever hear that deal that was a phony, that was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam, Hillary Clinton, shifty, Adam Schiff, it was a Democrat scam, and he had to go through that. And he did go through it.”

Trump continued, “We didn’t end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. Came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting. And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia, the 51 agents.

Russia Ukraine War,Jacobin,Left,https://jacobin.com/2025/03/liberal-delusions-ukraine-trump-zelensky,Y,"The horrific war in Ukraine is, in several senses, a lesson in imperialisms: classic versus new, formal versus informal, dumb versus smart. But it is also a general lesson in epistemologies, in the keys that we use to read the world, and their usefulness or otherwise. As such, they reveal intellectual, political, and moral bankruptcies.

The Follies of Discourse Theory in Practice

Once Russia invaded Ukraine, many seemed determined to deduce Russia’s war aims from its sentimental-ultranationalist folklore oriented toward the home front (and pleasing it) rather than examine Russia’s recent history, political economy, its position in the international arena of geopolitics and empire, and its concrete military-strategic approach to Ukraine. This choice, including by many on the Left, meant rejecting solid materialist analysis in favor of cheap discourse analysis, which happened to be in line with Western liberal state propaganda.

Those professionals who would rather look at what is being said instead of what is being done observed that Russian president Vladimir Putin had called the collapse of the Soviet Union the greatest tragedy of the twentieth century and had questioned Ukraine’s status as an independent nation-state. They concluded that Russia was obviously not only about to swallow up all of Ukraine but is eventually going to attack the rest of the post-Soviet world, including non-NATO states like Georgia, Moldova, and Kazakhstan, and even NATO ones like the Baltic states and their Russian minorities.

The discourse analysts engaged in this kind of fearmongering and legitimization of Western militarization not only despite the obvious gap between alleged will and capability. They have kept spinning that narrative despite the additional and obvious contradiction that — much like the Russian historical record of (geo-)political interests and verbalized demands — the Russian military-strategic approach at the beginning of the war pointed to rather different war aims.

Few would set about to conquer a nation-state of, at the time, still forty-four million people and 233,000 square miles, which is almost twice the size of Germany, with 190,000 soldiers. By comparison, in 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland (which was comparatively smaller in size and population and much less well defended) with 1.5 million soldiers who were supported by air attacks conducted by almost nine hundred air-raiding bombers and more than four hundred fighter planes. When Germany started its war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, it deployed three million soldiers, the largest invasion force assembled in world history, which nevertheless soon fortunately failed in its objectives.

For those whose idea it is to study history in real time instead of the real-time history of ideas (or, to be precise, propagandistic words), the Russian troop deployment underscored Russia’s war aims. Painting over domestic dissatisfactions was part of the story, but only part of it and, ironically, everyone who hates Putin and wants Russia’s regime to change would have had to embrace a politics of détente a long time ago in order to allow the internal contradictions to unfold. But beyond that: Putin sought to (1) enlarge and formally annex the mineral-rich Donbas as well as the future Russian oblasts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia (for which new maps had already been printed), thus (2) establishing a land connection to Crimea, annexed in 2014, and, most notably, (3) effecting “regime change” in Kyiv, which would guarantee that Ukraine, torn apart between East and West, remains neutral and is not turned into an outpost of NATO and US empire.

But why take the time to engage with global and regional history, international political economy, imperialism theory, and war studies just to find oneself in the uncomfortable position of being at odds with the propaganda and power of Western liberal states and state media and their interests? It’s easier to follow and perpetuate the Holocaust-relativizing narrative that Putin is like Adolf Hitler, his war in Ukraine is a “war of annihilation” (as German Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung editor Berthold Kohler relativized Nazi Germany’s Eastern war of annihilation, which in less than four years killed twenty-seven million Soviets); that Russia plans to invade Europe; and that, unless Europe becomes “fit for war” and “prepared for war with Russia” by 2029, turning itself into an authoritarian garrison state, Russia will be conquering Poland and marching toward Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, as the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock (a Green) predicts.

The same liberals who argue that Russia, despite its botched war effort in Ukraine, is omnipotent enough to attack NATO and conquer the EU are also the ones who have kept arguing that Russia is about to collapse any second and that Ukraine’s victory in the war is inevitable — trust us, it’ll take just one more round of Western weapons deliveries, massive gunpoint recruitment, and economic drafting of Ukrainian working-class youth.

But let us return to epistemologies, the keys to understanding. For some offer “analyses” of the shift of US foreign policy from Joe Biden to Donald Trump and the ongoing clash between the Trump administration and Zelensky in terms of references to personal ideology, individual will, and even irrational personalities, characterized by childish stubbornness, narcissistic vanity, and egoism.

In one example of many, Katrin Eigendorf, senior international correspondent and Eastern Europe war correspondent at German national television station ZDF, who is followed by close to 70,000 people and who probably, like 99 percent of the liberal commentariat did not watch the entire forty-nine minutes, stated that “rarely had Trump and [J. D.] Vance shown so clearly who their friend and who their enemy is.” According to Eigendorf’s posting, shared 400 times and liked a quarter of ten thousand, “the US president is Putin’s man who is adopting his lies.” Such readings are intellectually vapid returns to early-nineteenth-century Great Man theories of history.

So, how do we find ourselves after Friday’s staged Oval Office clash between Trump/Vance and Zelensky? There, Trump catered to his MAGA base and Americans more generally, Zelensky catered to his ultranationalist base, which may still kill him, and especially the Europeans luring them into prolonging the forlorn proxy war forcefully recruiting the Ukrainian working class and senselessly butchering both it and the Russian one.

But some refused to see that Trump was doing just this. The most ludicrous liberal takes readily blamed the US president’s move — i.e., the colonial exploitation of Ukraine at this historic juncture of geopolitical rivalry, state formation, and war — on Putin, i.e., the leader of a country with an economy the size of Italy, “having the United States in his pocket.” In other words, analytically liberals let the tail wag the dog while politically still barking up the wrong tree — and doing so in the dumbest kind of binary reductionism imaginable.

No matter how intellectually self-defeating these arguments were, they spread wildly across social media. From Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook to Elon Musk’s Twitter/X, hashtags trending internationally included #TrumpIsARussianAsset #TrumpIsANationalDisgrace, #PutinsPuppet, and #PutinsPuppets — showcasing the superiority of Western idiots over Russian bots.

Needless to say, liberals (including those who fancy themselves as left-wing or even Marxists) are shifting in this direction not simply because they have publicly declared intellectual bankruptcy. (Which they have — and for which we should hold them accountable. Because if anything comes out of this horrific bloodshed, it should be a paradigm shift back toward historic and materialist analysis in order to prevent the Ukrainian tragedy from being repeated as farce in some other proxy war).

Yes, liberals actually think like this. Worse, they continue to do so now despite glaring evidence to the contrary, because they have either followed their own imperial states’ propaganda or surrendered to its disciplinary power to a degree where they seek to postpone the inevitable moment of truth. Diving deeper into a world of pathological delusion is their way of not having to admit that they erred politically, and morally, as ever more lives were forcefully thrown into the meat grinder. This refusal is their way of not having to face up to a complete redoing of their academic education (which could lead to an epistemology capable of explaining the reality of war) and thus overhauling the way they make sense of the world.

Instead, liberal leftists double down. As much as they promote diversity and nonbinary thinking, the newest trend is a ridiculous form of binary reductionism. The same kind of liberals who are most outspoken against Trump dismantling DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) apparently cannot live without a world of black and white.

It amounts to nothing short of the infantilization and de-politicization of politics, removed from any basis in society. It operates by an old logic, of my enemy’s enemy is my friend:

We are against the far right, the far right is (or appears to be) against the EU, so we are for the EU.

We are against the far right, the far right is against Kamala Harris, so we are for Kamala Harris.

We are against Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocidal government is against Hamas, so we are for the genocidal Netanyahu government.

We are against Donald Trump, Trump insults Zelensky, so we — #IStandWithUkraine — are for Zelensky, even if he has his people forcibly recruited for a lost war.

We are against Trump, Trump — because he and Biden have already won everything that there was to be won short of a nuclear World War III — wants to end the unwinnable war through negotiations, so we are against negotiations and in favor of continuing the war.

And now we (the very same people who prevent our children from playing cowboys and Indians, who teach them that masculinity is toxic and who train them to verbalize things instead of roughing each other up) also empower the EU to sacrifice the European welfare states and democracies on the altar of war-producers like Rheinmetall, Thales, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. By the end of the decade, this “liberalism” will help ensure we are ruled not just by President Trump and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, but also by President Marine Le Pen, Prime Minister Geert Wilders, Chancellor Alice Weidel, and Interior Minister Björn Höcke.","The horrific war in Ukraine is, in several senses, a lesson in imperialisms: classic versus new, formal versus informal, dumb versus smart.

Russia Ukraine War,The Atlantic,Left,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/ukraine-us-relations-trump/681880/,Y,"Updated at 11:13 a.m. ET on March 1, 2025

Leave aside, if only for a moment, the utter boorishness with which President Donald Trump and Vice President J. D. Vance treated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House today. Also leave aside the spectacle of American leaders publicly pummeling a friend as if he were an enemy. All of the ghastliness inflicted on Zelensky today should not obscure the geopolitical reality of what just happened: The president of the United States ambushed a loyal ally, presumably so that he can soon make a deal with the dictator of Russia to sell out a European nation fighting for its very existence.

Trump’s advisers have already declared the meeting a win for “putting America first,” and his apologists will likely spin and rationalize this shameful moment as just a heated conversation—the kind of thing that in Washington-speak used to be called a “frank and candid exchange.” But this meeting reeked of a planned attack, with Trump unloading Russian talking points on Zelensky (such as blaming Ukraine for risking global war), all of it designed to humiliate the Ukrainian leader on national television and give Trump the pretext to do what he has indicated repeatedly he wants to do: side with Russian President Vladimir Putin and bring the war to an end on Russia’s terms. Trump is now reportedly considering the immediate end of all military aid to Ukraine because of Zelensky’s supposed intransigence during the meeting.

Vance’s presence at the White House also suggests that the meeting was a setup. Vance is usually an invisible backbencher in this administration, with few duties other than some occasional trolling of Trump’s critics. (The actual business of furthering Trump’s policies is apparently now Elon Musk’s job.) This time, however, he was brought in to troll not other Americans, but a foreign leader. Marco Rubio—in theory, America’s top diplomat—was also there, but he sat glumly and silently while Vance pontificated like an obnoxious graduate student.

Read: At least now we know the truth

Zelensky objected, as he should have, when the vice president castigated the Ukrainian president for not showing enough personal gratitude to Trump. And then in a moment of immense hypocrisy, Vance told Zelensky that it was “disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media.” But baiting Zelensky into fighting in front of the media was likely the plan all along, and Trump and Vance were soon both yelling at Zelensky. (“This is going to be great television,” Trump said during the meeting.) The president at times sounded like a Mafia boss—“You don’t have the cards”; “you’re buried there”—but in the end, he sounded like no one so much as Putin himself as he hollered about “gambling with World War III,” as if starting the biggest war in Europe in nearly a century was Zelensky’s idea.

After the meeting, Trump dismissed the Ukrainian leader and then issued a statement that could only have pleased Moscow:

I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.

Trump might as well have dictated this post on Truth Social before the meeting, because Zelensky didn’t stand a chance of having an actual discussion at the White House. When he showed Trump pictures of brutalized Ukrainian soldiers, Trump shrugged. “That’s tough stuff,” he muttered. Perhaps someone told Zelensky that Trump doesn’t read much, and reacts to images, but Trump, uncharacteristically, seems to have been determined to stay on message and pick a fight.

Vance, for his part, fully inhabited the role of a smarmy talk-show sidekick, jumping in to make sure the star got the support he needed while slamming one of the guests. The vice president is an unserious man who tries to insert himself into serious moments, but this time the stakes were much higher than the usual dustups with the media or congressional Democrats. He chuckled as Brian Glenn, a journalist from the right-wing channel Real America’s Voice who is reportedly dating Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, asked Zelensky the tough and incisive question of why he had not worn a suit in the Oval Office. (Perhaps he’ll ask Musk why he wore a hat and T-shirt to a Cabinet meeting, but I doubt it.)

The sheer rudeness shown to a foreign guest and friend of the United States was (to use a word) deplorable as a matter of manners and grace, but worse, Trump and Vance acted like a couple of online Kremlin sock puppets instead of American leaders. They pushed talking points that they either knew or should have known were wrong. Even if Zelensky were as fluent and capable in English as Winston Churchill, he would never have been able to rebut the flood of falsehoods. No, the U.S. has not given Ukraine $350 billion; yes, Zelensky has repeatedly expressed his thanks to America and to Trump; no, Zelensky was not attacking the administration. The Ukrainian leader did his best to stand up to the bullying, but Trump and Vance were playing to the cameras and the MAGA gallery at home.

Vance showed how dedicated he was to point-scoring rather than policy making with an observation so shallow that he was lucky that Zelensky was too off-balance to call him out for it. To emphasize Ukraine’s perilous situation, Vance noted that Zelensky was sending conscripts to the front lines, as if this was an unprecedented policy that only the most desperate regime would dare enact. Zelensky said that all nations at war have problems, but he might have pointed out to Vance that Ukraine is fighting for its very existence, while the United States has dragged conscripts to places far from home—including Korea and Vietnam—to fight against troops supported by the Kremlin.

Tom Nichols: Don’t blame Zelensky

Today’s meeting and America’s shameful vote in the United Nations on Monday confirmed that the United States is now aligned with Russia and against Ukraine, Europe, and most of the planet. I felt physically sick watching the president of the United States yell at a brave ally, fulminating in the Oval Office as if he were an addled old man shaking his fist at a television. Zelensky has endured tragedies, and risked his life, in ways that men such as Trump and Vance cannot imagine. (Vance served as a public-relations officer in the most powerful military in the world; he has never had to huddle in a bunker during a Russian bombardment.) I am ashamed for my nation; even if Congress acts to support and aid Ukraine, it cannot restore the American honor lost today.

But no matter how disgusted anyone might be at Trump and Vance’s behavior, the strategic reality is that this meeting is a catastrophe for the United States and the free world. America’s alliances are now in danger, and should be: Trump is openly, and gleefully, betraying everything America has tried to defend since the defeat of the Axis 80 years ago. The entire international order of peace and security is now in danger, as Russian autocrats, after slaughtering innocent people for three years, look forward to enjoying the spoils of their invasion instead of standing trial for their crimes. (Shortly after Trump dismissed Zelensky from the White House, Putin’s homunculus, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, posted on X: “The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office.”)

Friday, February 28, 2025, will go into the history books as one of the grimmest days in American diplomacy, the beginning of a long-term disaster that every American, every U.S. ally, and anyone who cares about the future of democracy will have to endure. With the White House’s betrayal of Ukraine capping a month of authoritarian chaos in America, Putin, along with other dictators around the world, can finally look at Trump with confidence and think: one of us.","Updated at 11:13 a.m. ET on March 1, 2025

Leave aside, if only for a moment, the utter boorishness with which President Trump and Vice President Vance treated Ukrainian President Zelensky at the White House today. Also leave aside the spectacle of American leaders publicly pummeling a friend as if he were an enemy. All of the ghastliness inflicted on Zelensky today should not obscure the geopolitical reality of what just happened: The president of the United States ambushed a loyal ally, presumably so that he can soon make a deal with the dictator of Russia to sell out a European nation fighting for its very existence.

Trump’s advisers have already declared the meeting a win for “putting America first,” and his apologists will likely spin and rationalize this shameful moment as just a heated conversation—the kind of thing that in Washington-speak used to be called a “frank and candid exchange.” But this meeting reeked of a planned attack, with Trump unloading Russian talking points on Zelensky (such as blaming Ukraine for risking global war), all of it designed to humiliate the Ukrainian leader on national television and give Trump the pretext to do what he has indicated repeatedly he wants to do: side with Russian President Putin and bring the war to an end on Russia’s terms. Trump is now reportedly considering the immediate end of all military aid to Ukraine because of Zelensky’s supposed intransigence during the meeting.

A potential deal between the United States and Ukraine intended to pave the way for an end to the war with Russia was up in the air Friday, after a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Friday grew contentious.

Trump told Zelenskyy, ""You're not acting at all thankful"" for the support Zelenskyy's country had received from the United States, adding that the Ukrainian leader had been disrespectful and telling him, ""You're gambling with World War III.""

Zelenskyy tried to object, saying he has ""all the respect for your country"" and saying, ""I said thanks,"" as Trump raised his voice to speak over him.

A scheduled news conference between the two men was subsequently canceled. Zelenskyy left the White House but didn't take questions.

Zelenskyy came to Washington and was expected to sign a deal that would give the United States access to Ukrainian rare earth and critical minerals. But the heated session — with raised voices and cross talk playing out in front of TV cameras — left the future of the negotiations uncertain.

The argument came at the end of a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, after Trump defended his approach with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he was trying to broker a deal between two parties.

""I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with,"" Trump said.

Vice President Vance then defended Trump's approach as ""diplomacy.""

That elicited a strong response from Zelenskyy, who said Putin had broken previous deals. ""He broke the ceasefire. He killed our people. ... What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?"" said Ukraine's president, who has been seeking greater security assurances as part of any deal to end the war.

Trump later told reporters, ""They should have an immediate ceasefire.""

Vance accused Zelenskyy of trying to ""litigate this in front of the American media,"" accusing him of running propaganda tours, campaigning for Democrats in Pennsylvania during the election and being ungrateful.

Zelenskyy asked, ""Have you ever been to Ukraine? Have you seen the problems we have? Come once.""

""Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,"" Vance said.

""During the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don't feel now. But you will feel it in the future. God bless, you will not have war,"" Zelenskyy said with his arms crossed. Trump interjected by saying, ""Don't tell us what we're gonna feel. We're trying to solve a problem.""

As the two leaders raised their voices, each trying to speak over the other, Zelenskyy said, ""You will feel influence.""

Zelenskyy addresses the tense meeting

Trump took to social media after the exchange, writing on his Truth Social platform that he had ""determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for peace.""

Zelenskyy addressed the tense exchange during an interview on Fox News, telling host Bret Baier that Ukraine was in fact ""ready for peace,"" while repeatedly stressing the importance of security guarantees for his country.

The Ukrainian leader said it was regrettable that the exchange occurred in front of cameras and not behind closed doors. ""Yes, I think it was not good,"" he said.

Zelenskyy expressed appreciation for American support in Ukraine's war with Russia. ""We're thankful to Americans for all your support. You did a lot. I'm thankful to President Trump and to Congress, bipartisan support, and I was always very thankful for all our people,"" he said.

He declined to answer directly when pressed on whether he owed President Trump an apology, but when asked whether his relationship with President Trump could be salvaged, Zelenskyy told Baier, ""Yes, of course.""

""The free world needs a new leader""

It marked a dramatic shift in the reception of Ukraine's leader in Washington, drawing criticism from top Democratic lawmakers.

""President Trump and his administration continue to embarrass America on the world stage,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. ""Trump and Vance are doing Putin's dirty work,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, also of New York, said on social media.

Leaders in Europe joined in the call for continued support for Ukraine.

French and British leaders — who have each visited the White House this week — called Zelenskyy to ensure him of Europe's total backing.

""There is an aggressor, which is Russia, and a people who have suffered aggression, which is Ukraine,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters, demanding respect for those fighting for ""their independence, for their children, and for the security of Europe.""

""We will step up our support to Ukraine,"" European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X. ""Today, it became clear that the free world needs a new leader. It's up to us, Europeans, to take this challenge.""

Russia Ukraine War,CNN,Lean Left,https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/europe/zelensky-trump-argument-comment-ukraine-intl/index.html,Y,"Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said his Oval Office meeting last week with US President Donald Trump “did not go the way it was supposed to,” describing the fiery meeting as “regrettable” and noting that Ukraine is ready to negotiate about an end to the conflict.

“I would like to reiterate Ukraine’s commitment to peace,” Zelensky said on X, addressing his remarkable sit-down with Trump directly. Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelensky during the meeting, angrily accusing him of “gambling with World War Three” and telling him: “Your country is in big trouble.”

“Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be,” Zelensky wrote in Tuesday’s X post. “It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right. We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive.”

“None of us wants an endless war,” he added. “Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.”

Western leaders will hope the statement goes some way towards smoothing Kyiv’s relations with the White House, but the disastrous Oval Office meeting underlined how strained that relationship has become.

Zelensky also said in his Tuesday statement that Ukraine is ready to sign a minerals deal, which was meant to be signed on Friday until the argument led to Zelensky being told to leave the White House.

“Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format. We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively,” he said.

And he made a rare direct intervention on how a possible ceasefire might work. “We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,” Zelensky said. “Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal.”

That framework is similar to the plan proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron after Sunday’s summit of Western leaders, which took place in London amid anxiety on the continent about Ukraine’s future.

“We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this,” Zelensky added.

It remains to be seen how Trump will respond to the Ukrainian leader’s proposals or his reflections on the White House visit. But the lengthy statement suggests an effort by Kyiv to force its voice into discussions on the conflict’s future, after the Trump administration opened talks with Russia last month and refused to invite Ukraine.

Trump on Monday ordered a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine, which could have a dire effect on the country’s war-fighting abilities. The halt in aid, which came after Trump held a series of meetings with top national security officials, will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said – essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield.","Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —

LONDON -- President Donald Trump on Monday blasted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for saying a peace deal is ""very far.""

""The final deal about ending the war is very, very far. Nobody's even started all those steps yet,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday on his way home from London after a summit with European leaders.

Trump called it ""the worst statement that could have been made"" by the Ukrainian president, writing on Truth Social, in part: ""This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!""

When asked Monday afternoon by ABC News Senior Politics Correspondent Rachel Scott what he needs to see from Zelenskyy to restart negotiations on a peace deal, Trump replied: ""Well, I just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.""

Scott also asked the president about Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov recently saying the administration's foreign policy is ""largely in line with our vision.""

""Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you're going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you're going to have to make a deal with Ukraine,"" Trump replied.

""If somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long. That person will not be listened to very long,"" Trump also said, in part. ""I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe certainly the people of Ukraine want to make a deal. They've suffered more than anybody else. We talk about suffering. They've suffered.""

Zelenskyy earlier Monday expressed gratitude for years of American backing in a statement ending a tumultuous week of transatlantic diplomacy that saw a dramatic and public break with Trump's administration.

Zelenskyy framed this week's outreach as the beginning of a longer process that may result in a peace deal to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of his country. ""There will be many meetings and joint efforts in the coming days and weeks,"" Zelenskyy said in a video posted to the presidential website.

""There will be diplomacy for peace,"" he added. ""And for the sake of all of us standing together -- Ukraine, the whole of Europe, and necessarily America.""

The Kremlin, meanwhile, said Monday it was ""very important"" to push Zelenskyy toward making a peace deal, echoing arguments made by Trump in Friday's contentious Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

""He does not want peace. Someone should make Zelenskyy want peace,"" Peskov said, his remarks reflecting Russia's long-standing false narrative blaming Kyiv for Moscow's three-year-old invasion and more than a decade of cross-border aggression.

""If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised,"" Peskov said.

On Monday, Zelenskyy reacted to another night of Russian long-range missile and drone strikes, writing on Telegram, ""Ukraine is fighting for the normal and safe life it deserves, for a peace that is just and reliable. We want this war to end. But Russia does not want it and continues its aerial terror.""

""Those who want negotiations do not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles,"" the president added. ""To force Russia to stop the strikes, we need a greater joint force of the world.""

Trump was expected to meet with his top national security advisers Monday afternoon for a briefing on Ukraine, multiple sources told ABC News.

The briefing will include national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. The group will discuss next steps after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House after last week's explosive Oval Office meeting.

Zelenskyy's fiery Friday meeting with Trump and Vice President JD Vance demonstrated the divergence in Ukrainian and U.S. visions of Russia's war, blame for which Trump has repeatedly and falsely attributed to Kyiv while also seeking to undermine Zelenskyy's legitimacy.

Russian officials celebrated the disastrous meeting. Peskov told state television on Sunday that Trump's administration is ""rapidly changing"" American ""foreign policy configurations,"" putting them ""largely in line with our vision.""

In his Sunday statement, Zelenskyy said Ukrainians ""understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we have received from the United States. There hasn't been a single day when we haven't felt grateful. Because this is gratitude for the preservation of our independence.""

""We need peace, not endless war,"" he added. ""And that is why we say that security guarantees are the key to this.""

Zelenskyy attended a summit of European leaders in London on Sunday. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he had agreed with Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron that the U.K. and France would work with Ukraine to formulate a peace plan that will then be presented to the U.S.

Starmer outlined a plan including the continuation of aid flows to Ukraine and the maintaining of economic pressure on Russia. The prime minister said that any lasting peace agreement must ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and security, and that Kyiv must be at the negotiating table.

In the event of a deal, Starmer said Europe will continue to help Ukraine militarily to deter any future military action by Russia. He also said there will be a ""coalition of the willing"" to help defend Ukraine.

Starmer said the United Kingdom is ready to back the plan with boots on the ground and planes in the air. He said he also recognizes that not all countries will be able to make this kind of commitment.

Starmer stressed that any deal will need strong U.S. backing to succeed.

Zelenskyy said Sunday he had been given ""clear support from Europe,"" reporting ""even greater unity, even stronger readiness for cooperation"" from his weekend meetings.

""Everyone is united on the main point -- for peace to be real, real security guarantees are needed,"" the president said. ""And this is the position of all of our Europe -- of the entire continent.""

""In the near future, all of us in Europe will shape our common positions -- the lines we must achieve and the lines we cannot compromise on,"" Zelenskyy said. ""These positions will be presented to our partners in the United States.""

""Robust and lasting peace, and the right agreement on the end of the war are truly our shared priority,"" he added.

Trump blasts Zelenskyy for saying peace is 'very, very far'

LONDON -- President Trump on Monday blasted Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for saying a peace deal is ""very far.""

""The final deal about ending the war is very, very far. Nobody's even started all those steps yet,"" Zelenskyy said Sunday on his way home from London after a summit with European leaders.

Trump called it ""the worst statement that could have been made"" by the Ukrainian president, writing on Truth Social, in part: ""This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!""

When asked Monday afternoon by ABC News Senior Politics Correspondent Rachel Scott what he needs to see from Zelenskyy to restart negotiations on a peace deal, Trump replied: ""Well, I just think he should be more appreciative because this country has stuck with them through thick and thin.""

Scott also asked the president about Kremlin spokesperson Peskov recently saying the administration's foreign policy is ""largely in line with our vision.""

""Well, I tell you what, I think it takes two to tango, and you're going to have to make a deal with Russia, and you're going to have to make a deal with Ukraine,"" Trump replied.

""If somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long. That person will not be listened to very long,"" Trump also said, in part. ""I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe certainly the people of Ukraine want to make a deal. They've suffered more than anybody else. We talk about suffering. They've suffered.""

Zelenskyy earlier Monday expressed gratitude for years of American backing in a statement ending a tumultuous week of transatlantic diplomacy that saw a dramatic and public break with Trump's administration.

Zelenskyy framed this week's outreach as the beginning of a longer process that may result in a peace deal to end Russia's three-year-old invasion of his country. ""There will be many meetings and joint efforts in the coming days and weeks,"" Zelenskyy said in a video posted to the presidential website.

""There will be diplomacy for peace,"" he added. ""And for the sake of all of us standing together -- Ukraine, the whole of Europe, and necessarily America.""

The Kremlin, meanwhile, said Monday it was ""very important"" to push Zelenskyy toward making a peace deal, echoing arguments made by Trump in Friday's contentious Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian leader.

""He does not want peace. Someone should make Zelenskyy want peace,"" Peskov said, his remarks reflecting Russia's long-standing false narrative blaming Kyiv for Moscow's three-year-old invasion and more than a decade of cross-border aggression.

""If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised,"" Peskov said.

On Monday, Zelenskyy reacted to another night of Russian long-range missile and drone strikes, writing on Telegram, ""Ukraine is fighting for the normal and safe life it deserves, for a peace that is just and reliable. We want this war to end. But Russia does not want it and continues its aerial terror.""

President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy of being “disrespectful” during a combative visit to the White House on Friday that often verged on a shouting match—resulting in an early end to talks as Trump pushes for a negotiated halt to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Key Facts

After the fight, Zelenskyy left the White House early and a planned press conference involving him and Trump was canceled, after Zelenskyy and his delegation were asked to leave the White House, according to multiple outlets, citing unnamed officials. The Oval Office meeting—which included reporters and TV cameras—grew tense after Vance defended Trump’s controversial push for a deal with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, saying “the path to peace … is maybe engaging in diplomacy,” and Zelenskyy responded by arguing Putin has been unreliable, pointing to prior deals made with Putin: “What kind of diplomacy, JD, (are you) speaking about?” Vance then confronted Zelenskyy, claiming the Ukrainian president was being “disrespectful” for publicly trying to “litigate this in front of the American media.” Vance asserted that Zelenskyy should thank Trump for his efforts to end Ukraine’s war with Russia and pointed to Ukraine’s struggles with “manpower,” but Zelenskyy rebutted, saying, “everybody has problems, even [the U.S.], but you have a nice ocean and don’t feel it now, but you will feel it in the future.” (Zelensky also said he has thanked the U.S.) Trump interrupted Zelenskyy: “Don’t tell us what we’re gonna feel, we’re trying to solve a problem.” Trump, raising his voice, then claimed Ukraine was “not really in a good position right now” and that Zelenskyy was “gambling with World War III,” and at one point said, “it’s gonna be a very hard thing to do business like this.” Trump also said: “I’ve empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don’t think you’d be a tough guy without the United States.” Toward the end of the meeting, Trump said to Zelenskyy, regarding Russia talks: “You’re either gonna make a deal or we are out, and if we’re out, you’ll fight it out. I don’t think it’s gonna be pretty, but you’ll fight it out.”

Chief Critic

Following the meeting, Trump wrote on Truth Social saying Zelenskyy “disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office,” and that Zelenskyy can “come back when he is ready for peace.” Trump added, “It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that [Zelenskyy] is not ready for peace if America is involved because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations.”

Crucial Quote

“Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,” Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding, “Thank you [Trump], Congress and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.”

Republican Lawmakers Defend And Praise Trump

Several Republican lawmakers backed Trump, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsay Graham, who said he didn’t “know if we can ever do business with Zelenskyy again.” Graham also suggested Zelenskyy should either resign or “send somebody over that we can do business with.” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement posted to X that “what we witnessed in the Oval Office today was an American President putting America first,” and added, “the days of America being taken advantage of disrespected are OVER.” Other Republicans praised Trump for “standing up for America,” including Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.), Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), Jim Justice (R-W.Va) and Bill Haggerty (R-Tenn.).

Democratic Lawmakers Slam Trump’s Treatment Of Zelenskyy

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., criticized Vance and Trump, noting Zelenskyy had “thanked our country over and over again both privately and publicly,” adding, “Shame on you.” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump and Vance of doing “Putin’s dirty work.” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., called the meeting an “utter embarrassment for America,” and Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said on MSNBC it was a “complete and utter mess” and “a gift to Putin ... this makes us look weak, and it’s not normal behavior.”

What To Watch For

Whether Ukraine and the U.S. move forward with a deal involving Ukraine and the U.S. jointly developing Ukrainian minerals, oils and gas. Zelenskyy left the White House without signing the deal, according to the Associated Press. Trump previously demanded Ukraine supply $500 billion in rare minerals to the U.S. as repayment for the money and military equipment it has sent Ukraine to finance its war efforts.

Key Background

A strained meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy followed weeks of an escalating feud between the two leaders. Trump has pushed for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia to accelerate, though he had shifted negotiations away from Ukraine and accused Zelenskyy of being a “dictator” who “refuses to have elections.” Trump appeared to walk back calling Zelenskyy a dictator on Thursday, saying, “I can’t believe I said that,” while noting he believes he and Zelenskyy “have had a very good relationship” that “maybe got a little bit testy.” Trump previously called on Zelenskyy to “move fast” to achieve peace with Russia or “he is not going to have a country left.” In response, Zelenskyy claims Trump has “helped Putin out” by holding talks without inviting Ukrainian officials, and Trump previously suggested Ukraine should have made more concessions to Russia to stop the war from happening. Zelensky has warned Ukraine would not accept a peace deal if only Trump and Russia are involved.

And now we bring you some more reactions from Democrats in Congress who seem to be aligned in how they view the Oval Office meeting - that Trump and Vance attacked Zelensky to help or to impress Putin.

Here are some notable comments from top Democratic lawmakers:

Representative Hakeem Jefffies, the highest-ranking Democrat in the House: ""Todayâs White House meeting with the President of Ukraine was appalling and will only serve to further embolden Vladimir Putin, a brutal dictator.

Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the most senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, to a reporter: ""It's distressing to see the President... is walking away from our commitment in Ukraine, and doesn't seem to understand what a murderous dictator Vladimir Putin is.""

Representative Gregory Meeks, the most senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee: ""Trumpâs actions today undermined U.S. leadership, emboldened our adversaries, humiliated both himself and his Republican Party, and insulted the generations of Americans who fought and died to build Americaâs standing in the world.

Senator Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran: ""Attacking our democratic partner in service of an autocratic dictator. Trump is a national disgrace.""

Representative Ted Lieu, a long-serving member of the House who sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee: ""Nobody is celebrating President Trump and Vice President Vanceâs embarrassing behavior in the Oval Office more than Vladimir Putin. Today was a distressing moment for those of us who value democracy and Americaâs role as a force for good.""

Senator Chris Murphy, a more liberal Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who has emerged as one of Trump's fiercest critics, on X: ""What just happened in the Oval Office was a planned ambush, designed to help a brutal Russian dictator and hurt America's security. Trump has become Putin's lapdog, and America's global power is hemorrhaging as America sides with dictators over democracy.

Russia Ukraine War,Washington examiner,Lean Right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3333643/trump-lambastes-zelensky-oval-office/,Y,"President Donald Trump‘s visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House derailed into heated outbursts on camera, endangering the Trump administration’s progress on negotiating a precursory rare earth minerals agreement and an end to the war in Ukraine.

The palpable tension, including the president yelling at Zelensky, played out before reporters brought into the Oval Office, and it resulted in the cancellation of the leaders’ scheduled joint press conference and Zelensky’s premature exit from the White House. The US-Ukraine mineral deal that prompted Friday’s visit was never signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Trump said in a statement following the meeting. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

The Oval Office meeting, which, at one point, saw Trump and Vice President JD Vance accuse Zelensky of being “disrespectful” to the U.S., was unprecedented. Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, was in the Oval Office and had her head in her hands throughout the argument.

Trump, at least, joked that the heated exchange made for “great television.”

The meeting started amicably, though the president did slight Zelensky for wearing a long-sleeved Henley T-shirt upon his arrival, joking, “He’s all dressed up” to reporters.

Zelensky opened by showing photographs from the war as a reminder of Russia’s aggression and the toll it has had on his people. He also brought Ukrainian heavyweight boxer Oleksandr Usyk and his championship belt.

Trump then spoke about his legacy if he could negotiate peace between Russia and Ukraine.

“I hope I’m going to be remembered as a peacemaker,” he said. “I’m doing this to save lives — more than anything else.”

But even while seated next to Zelensky, Trump was hesitant to blame Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion and defended his own public comments regarding Putin in recent days.

“You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say, ‘Hi, Vladimir. How are we doing on the deal?’ It doesn’t work that way,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. “I’m not aligned with anybody. I’m aligned with the United States of America and for the good of the world.”

Tensions fully boiled over when Vance accused Zelensky of not saying “thank you” to the president, to which Zelensky challenged the vice president to visit Ukraine.

“You went to Pennsylvania to campaign for the opposition,” the vice president continued, referencing a September visit the Ukrainian president made to the 2024 battleground with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

“You’re gambling with World War III,” Trump proceeded to chime in after Zelensky attempted to counter Vance’s critiques. “You’ve got to be more thankful because, let me tell you, you don’t have the cards.”

“This was supposed to be over quickly, and here we are three years later,” he said. “You have to be very proud, but now we want to get it over with. It’s enough.”

A source familiar with the White House meeting contended Trump and Vance “were caught off guard by Zelensky’s antics” and that they did not plan to have an acrimonious meeting ahead of time.

After Zelensky left the White House, he posted a thank-you note to Trump, Congress, and the American people.

Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people.

Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. — Volodymyr Zelenskyy / Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 28, 2025

“Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that,” he added.

Trump received criticism from both sides of the aisle for his outburst.

Former Bush administration adviser Karl Rove said on Fox News that “the only winner out of today is Vladimir Putin.”

“This is a mistake to have it broadcast. It was a mistake for Zelensky to get his dander up. It was a mistake for the president and vice president to be so public in their comments,” he continued.

Andrew Bates, a senior deputy press secretary under former President Joe Biden, told the Washington Examiner that Trump is catering to Putin’s wishes, at the detriment of the public.

“President Zelensky is fighting for America’s national security interests and values a hell of a lot better than Donald Trump is,” he said in a statement.

Zelensky’s visit comes after a roller coaster in relations between him and Trump.

The pair’s relationship dates back to 2019 and the phone call that precipitated Trump’s first impeachment.

In the Oval Office before his meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump acknowledged his relationship with Zelensky has been “testy” at times.

In recent weeks, the relationship has eroded further. Zelensky was resistant to the U.S. terms of a rare earth minerals deal despite the Ukrainian president initially proposing it. The first drafts of an agreement, though, included U.S. demands for $500 billion, more than what the U.S. has provided Ukraine. Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. has provided Ukraine with $350 billion in aid, but the number is closer to half of that.

Trump has also said Ukraine and former President Joe Biden were responsible for the war, regardless of Russia being the aggressor. Trump’s allegations prompted Zelensky to describe the president as living in a “disinformation” space, with Trump responding that Zelensky is a “dictator” because Ukraine has suspended elections, an emergency power permitted under the country’s constitution.

But as Zelensky warmed to the minerals deal, even without traditional security guarantees, so, too, has his relationship with Trump, until Friday’s public lashing.

Beside Starmer in the Oval Office and then in the East Room for the pair’s joint press conference, Trump was pushed to defend his description of Zelensky as a “dictator.”

“Did I say that? I can’t believe I said that,” Trump said.

‘DID I SAY THAT’: TRUMP QUESTIONS WHETHER HE CALLED ZELENSKY A ‘DICTATOR’

Then, during the press conference, Trump was asked whether he owed Zelensky an apology for using the descriptor. In reaction, the president adopted a more deferential tone.

“I have a lot of respect for him,” he said. “We’ve given them a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure it.”","President Trump‘s visit with Ukrainian President Zelensky at the White House derailed into heated outbursts on camera, endangering the Trump administration’s progress on negotiating a precursory rare earth minerals agreement and an end to the war in Ukraine.

The palpable tension, including the president yelling at Zelensky, played out before reporters brought into the Oval Office, and it resulted in the cancellation of the leaders’ scheduled joint press conference and Zelensky’s premature exit from the White House. The US-Ukraine mineral deal that prompted Friday’s visit was never signed.

“I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations,” Trump said in a statement following the meeting. “I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.”

The Oval Office meeting, which, at one point, saw Trump and Vice President Vance accuse Zelensky of being “disrespectful” to the U.S., was unprecedented. Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, was in the Oval Office and had her head in her hands throughout the argument.

Trump, at least, joked that the heated exchange made for “great television.”

The meeting started amicably, though the president did slight Zelensky for wearing a long-sleeved Henley T-shirt upon his arrival, joking, “He’s all dressed up” to reporters.

Russia Ukraine War,Daily mail,Right,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14448273/Trump-slams-disrespectful-Zelensky-blistering-Oval-Office-row-You-gambling-World-War-Three.html,Y,"President Donald Trump abruptly halted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and kicked President Volodymyr Zelensky out of the White House after a blistering Oval Office shouting match between the two leaders.

Friday proved an extraordinary day at the White House, which saw Zelensky walk out of the West Wing and slip into his SUV following an explosive encounter with the president. He was driven away under a flood of camera lights and left dozens of unanswered questions.

The unprecedented scene left Ukraine's future in doubt as the country fights for its life.

Tempers flared on all sides during the Oval Office showdown. Trump threatened to abandon Ukraine completely if Zelensky did not agree to his peace terms. He also accused Zelensky of not being grateful.

Zelensky held his own, even showing Trump photos he brought of the devastation to his country, and arguing he had thanked the American people.

The yelling match was unlike anything ever seen publicly in the Oval Office. And it played out on TV screens across the world.

'You're gambling with World War III,' Trump bellowed Zelensky at one point.

Both men were tense and on the defensive as they repeatedly tried to talk over one another. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., seated to the side in the Oval Office, buried her face in her hands.

After the contentious meeting Trump announced he had asked Zelensky to leave.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote:. 'It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved.

'Because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.'

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky departs the White House

The set up for a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and U.S. President Donald Trump which was canceled following their Oval Office meeting

After the cameras left the Oval Office, Zelensky went to a holding room in the West Wing. He and Trump did not meet again.

Trump issued his statement. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who were in the Oval Office meeting, went and told Zelensky his meetings at the White House were over, a White House official said.

The two leaders never had their scheduled lunch. White House reporters saw it sitting in the hallway outside the Oval Office, untouched.

Trump and Zelensky had been scheduled to participate in a press conference later Friday. That was canceled.

Zelensky was seen exiting the White House about two hours after his arrival. He then posted his own message on social media.

He wrote: : 'Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.'

The shocking development comes after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House this week in an attempt to gain some sympathy for Ukraine from Trump.

It's not immediately clear how the dramatic fallout will affect peace talks.

But Russia approved.

'The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is ""gambling with WWIII,""' wrote Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Medvedev on X.

Additionally, the U.S. has given billions to the Ukraine for its fight. Trump and Zelensky were scheduled to sign a deal to give U.S. access to some of Ukraine's rare earth minerals as part of a repayment plan. That trillion dollar deal was not inked.

All this leaves the future of the Ukraine in question.

The day started off pleasant enough with Trump greeting Zelensky at the West Wing door. He even joked the Ukrainian president 'dressed up' for the occasion.

But their Oval Office meeting divulged at the 40-minute mark after Vice President JD Vance accused Zelensky of not being grateful.

That set off Trump. Both men demanded Zelensky say 'thank you.'

Trump was repeatedly shouting over Zelensky as he tried to defend his position.

President Donald Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's meeting in the Oval Office became a shouting match

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky leaves the White House

It started when Trump got pressed on historic Russian domination of its neighbors and repositioning the U.S. toward Russia.

'If I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal,' Trump explained. 'You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say: 'Hi, Vladimir. How are we doing on the deal? It doesn't work that way. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America.'

Then Vice President JD Vance jumped in.

'I will respond to this. So look, for four years the United States of America, we had a president who stood up the press conferences and talked tough about Vladimir Putin, and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country,' said Vance.

'The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy.

Then a fight over history ensued, as Zelensky ran through Ukraine's 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea. After Zelensky mentioned 2015, Trump jumped in: 'I was not here.'

'But during 2014 till 2022 … people have been dying on the contact line.

President Zelensky and President Trump both shouted in their meeting

Then he brought up broken ceasefire and other agreements. 'What kind of diplomacy JD was speaking about?,' asked Zelensky.

'I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country, Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,' Vance told Zelensky, whose country has been under siege since 2022, and who came to Washington to ink a deal that will give the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.'

'Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems, you should be thanking the president,' Vance told him.

Vance accused Zelensky of bringing in dignitaries to his country on 'a propaganda tour'

'Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?' Vance berated him.

Zelensky tried to respond, but that only got Trump's ire up.

'Don't tell us what we're going to feel, because you're in no position to dictate,' he said.

'You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,' Trump told Zelensky, after last week calling him a 'dictator' and blaming Ukraine for starting the war.

Yelling with his face getting red, Trump intoned: 'You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now … You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

Vice President JD Vance injected into the conversation to criticize Zelensky

President Trump gives Zelensky a friendly tap

The day started off pleasantly: President Donald Trump welcomed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House

'You're gambling with World War Three. You're gambling with World War Three, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country – this country that's backed to you far more than a lot of people say they should have.

'Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting,' Vance said next in the tag team pile-on.

'You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October,' Vance, said, characterizing Zelensky's trip to an ammunition factory.

'Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,' he demanded.

'You think that, if you will speak very loudly,' Zelensky tried to counter in his accented English.

'He's not speaking loudly,' Trump said. 'Your country is in big trouble.'

'I know,' Zelensky responded. 'You're not winning. You're not winning this,' Trump told him.

Zelensky got a moment to try to counter, saying ‘in our country, staying strong, from the very beginning of the war, we've been alone, and we are thankful.’

Trump contradicted him, telling him he hadn’t been alone.

‘We gave you, through this stupid president, $350 billion we gave you military equipment,’ he said, overstating the amount of military hardware.

Trump said Zelensky’s men are ‘brave,’ but then told him, ‘If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.’

‘It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,’ Trump said.

That brought Vance back to demanding thanks.

‘Just say thank you,’ Vance told him.

‘I said it a lot of times,’ Zelensky responded.

Then Trump gave remarks indicating the blow-up was serving a purpose for him.

‘I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful you don't have the cards. You're buried there. You people are dying. You're running low on soldiers,’ Trump said.

‘You're running low on soldiers. Listen, you're running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. Then you tell us, “I don't want a cease fire. I don't want a cease fire,’ Trump said, delivering a mocking impression of his counterpart. ‘I want to go, and I want this – look, you could get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.’

‘Of course I want to stop the war. What I said to you – with guarantees,’ Zelensky said. He has been pushing for security guarantees from the U.S.

Shortly after the argument, Trump ended the public part of the meeting.

'This is going to be great television, I will say that,' he said.

As press was being ushered out, President Trump reached over and patted Zelensky's shoulder.

As this all went on, one White House staffer whispered to another: 'This is going to be big.'","President Trump abruptly halted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine and kicked President Zelensky out of the White House after a blistering Oval Office shouting match between the two leaders.

Friday proved an extraordinary day at the White House, which saw Zelensky walk out of the West Wing and slip into his SUV following an explosive encounter with the president. He was driven away under a flood of camera lights and left dozens of unanswered questions.

The unprecedented scene left Ukraine's future in doubt as the country fights for its life.

Tempers flared on all sides during the Oval Office showdown. Trump threatened to abandon Ukraine completely if Zelensky did not agree to his peace terms. He also accused Zelensky of not being grateful.

Zelensky held his own, even showing Trump photos he brought of the devastation to his country, and arguing he had thanked the American people.

The yelling match was unlike anything ever seen publicly in the Oval Office. And it played out on TV screens across the world.

'You're gambling with World War III,' Trump bellowed Zelensky at one point.

Both men were tense and on the defensive as they repeatedly tried to talk over one another. Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., seated to the side in the Oval Office, buried her face in her hands.

After the contentious meeting Trump announced he had asked Zelensky to leave.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote:. 'It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for Peace if America is involved.

'Because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.'

Ukraine's President Zelensky departs the White House

The set up for a press conference with Ukrainian President Zelensky and U.S. President Trump which was canceled following their Oval Office meeting

After the cameras left the Oval Office, Zelensky went to a holding room in the West Wing. He and Trump did not meet again.

Trump issued his statement. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who were in the Oval Office meeting, went and told Zelensky his meetings at the White House were over, a White House official said.

The two leaders never had their scheduled lunch. White House reporters saw it sitting in the hallway outside the Oval Office, untouched.

Trump and Zelensky had been scheduled to participate in a press conference later Friday. That was canceled.

Zelensky was seen exiting the White House about two hours after his arrival. He then posted his own message on social media.

He wrote: : 'Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit. Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people. Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that.'

The shocking development comes after French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Keir Starmer visited the White House this week in an attempt to gain some sympathy for Ukraine from Trump.

It's not immediately clear how the dramatic fallout will affect peace talks.

But Russia approved.

'The insolent pig finally got a proper slap down in the Oval Office. And @realDonaldTrump is right: The Kiev regime is ""gambling with WWIII,""' wrote Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Medvedev on X.

Additionally, the U.S. has given billions to the Ukraine for its fight. Trump and Zelensky were scheduled to sign a deal to give U.S. access to some of Ukraine's rare earth minerals as part of a repayment plan. That trillion dollar deal was not inked.

All this leaves the future of the Ukraine in question.

The day started off pleasant enough with Trump greeting Zelensky at the West Wing door. He even joked the Ukrainian president 'dressed up' for the occasion.

But their Oval Office meeting divulged at the 40-minute mark after Vice President Vance accused Zelensky of not being grateful.

That set off Trump. Both men demanded Zelensky say 'thank you.'

Trump was repeatedly shouting over Zelensky as he tried to defend his position.

President Trump and Ukraine's President Zelensky's meeting in the Oval Office became a shouting match

Ukrainian President Zelensky leaves the White House

It started when Trump got pressed on historic Russian domination of its neighbors and repositioning the U.S. toward Russia.

'If I didn't align myself with both of them, you'd never have a deal,' Trump explained. 'You want me to say really terrible things about Putin and then say: 'Hi, Vladimir. How are we doing on the deal? It doesn't work that way. I'm not aligned with anybody. I'm aligned with the United States of America.'

Then Vice President Vance jumped in.

'I will respond to this. So look, for four years the United States of America, we had a president who stood up the press conferences and talked tough about Putin, and then Putin invaded Ukraine and destroyed a significant chunk of the country,' said Vance.

'The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy.

Then a fight over history ensued, as Zelensky ran through Ukraine's 2014 illegal annexation of Crimea. After Zelensky mentioned 2015, Trump jumped in: 'I was not here.'

'But during 2014 till 2022 … people have been dying on the contact line.

President Zelensky and President Trump both shouted in their meeting

Then he brought up broken ceasefire and other agreements. 'What kind of diplomacy JD was speaking about?,' asked Zelensky.

'I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country, Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media,' Vance told Zelensky, whose country has been under siege since 2022, and who came to Washington to ink a deal that will give the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.'

'Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems, you should be thanking the president,' Vance told him.

Vance accused Zelensky of bringing in dignitaries to his country on 'a propaganda tour'

'Do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?' Vance berated him.

Zelensky tried to respond, but that only got Trump's ire up.

'Don't tell us what we're going to feel, because you're in no position to dictate,' he said.

'You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position,' Trump told Zelensky, after last week calling him a 'dictator' and blaming Ukraine for starting the war.

Yelling with his face getting red, Trump intoned: 'You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now … You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

Vice President Vance injected into the conversation to criticize Zelensky

President Trump gives Zelensky a friendly tap

The day started off pleasantly: President Trump welcomed Ukraine's President Zelensky to the White House

'You're gambling with World War Three. You're gambling with World War Three, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country – this country that's backed to you far more than a lot of people say they should have.

'Have you said thank you once, this entire meeting,' Vance said next in the tag team pile-on.

'You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October,' Vance, said, characterizing Zelensky's trip to an ammunition factory.

'Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country,' he demanded.

'You think that, if you will speak very loudly,' Zelensky tried to counter in his accented English.

'He's not speaking loudly,' Trump said. 'Your country is in big trouble.'

'I know,' Zelensky responded. 'You're not winning. You're not winning this,' Trump told him.

Zelensky got a moment to try to counter, saying ‘in our country, staying strong, from the very beginning of the war, we've been alone, and we are thankful.’

Trump contradicted him, telling him he hadn’t been alone.

‘We gave you, through this stupid president, $350 billion we gave you military equipment,’ he said, overstating the amount of military hardware.

Trump said Zelensky’s men are ‘brave,’ but then told him, ‘If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.’

‘It’s going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,’ Trump said.

That brought Vance back to demanding thanks.

‘Just say thank you,’ Vance told him.

‘I said it a lot of times,’ Zelensky responded.

Then Trump gave remarks indicating the blow-up was serving a purpose for him.

‘I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful you don't have the cards. You're buried there. You people are dying. You're running low on soldiers,’ Trump said.

‘You're running low on soldiers. Listen, you're running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. Then you tell us, “I don't want a cease fire. I don't want a cease fire,’ Trump said, delivering a mocking impression of his counterpart. ‘I want to go, and I want this – look, you could get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed.’

Tariffs,AP news,Left,https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-revenue-billions-fact-focus-a74e9640e4f0976121a2f43cf3f9ca05,Y,"President Donald Trump makes no secret of his love of tariffs. He heralds them as a way of bringing in revenue, striking back at countries he sees as taking advantage of the U.S. in trade, and as a cudgel to push countries to do what he wants. Even Canada and Mexico have been handed heavy taxes.

On April 2, Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all trading partners, only to roll most of them back on April 9 after the stock market tanked.

Still, he claims that tariffs, a tax on imported goods, are bringing in billions of dollars a day. On April 8, speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee Dinner, he said, “We’re making a fortune with tariffs. $2 billion a day. Do you believe it? I was told $2 billion a day.”

Here’s a look at the facts.

—

CLAIM: The U.S. is earning $2 billion per day from tariffs.

THE FACTS: That’s false. Trump began raising tariffs in February. That month, about $7.247 billion in customs duties were collected, or $258.82 million per day. In March, the most recent monthly figure available, a total of about $8.168 billion in customs duties was collected, or approximately $263.48 million per day. A customs duty is a type of tariff.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in an April 8 statement that as a result of 13 tariff-related presidential actions taken by Trump, it was collecting each day “over $200 million in additional associated revenue.” The agency is responsible for collecting tariffs.

Those numbers are in line with what the U.S. has taken in thus far during fiscal year 2025, which started Oct. 1 under the Biden administration. According to the latest Treasury Department numbers, $56.215 billion in customs duties and certain excise taxes have been collected, or $283.91 if broken out per day. An excise tax is also a type of tariff.

The U.S. has collected approximately $3.076 billion in customs and certain excise taxes so far this month, coming out to about $180.94 million per day, according to the Treasury Department’s data.

Economists suggest that Trump’s number is likely based on the value of imported goods from fiscal year 2024, disregarding the impact higher tariffs will have on supply and demand.

“It’s almost certainly the case we’re collecting less than that,” said Robert Johnson, an associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, of Trump’s $2 billion per day figure.

The U.S. took in about $3.3 trillion worth of goods in fiscal year 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Applying the average tariff rate Trump announced on April 2 — 20% — to that figure comes out to $660 billion worth of revenue. That’s roughly $1.8 billion per day.

But, economists note, this calculation does not account for behavioral changes. For example, if tariffs increase and make a product less profitable, importers may cease importing it altogether. And if consumers face higher prices due to increased tariffs, they may choose not to buy certain items.

“That’s the most optimistic scenario, because that won’t happen,” said Felix Tintelnot, an associate professor of economics at Duke University, of Trump’s $2 billion figure. “You can’t do a calculation of expected tariff revenue off past trade flows and then multiply with it a currently applied tariff and expect that the past trade flow remains the same.”

Ryan Monarch, an assistant professor of economics at Syracuse University, agreed, noting, “it’s a very bad assumption to assume that purchases are just completely unchanged.”

Not to mention, it is U.S. importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, not foreign governments. That money goes to the U.S. Treasury and those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices.

Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices — and sacrifice profits — to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the U.S.

Tariffs,The Guardian,Left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/trump-tariffs-will-send-global-trade-into-reverse-this-year-warns-wto,Y,"Donald Trump’s tariffs will send international trade into reverse this year, depressing global economic growth, the World Trade Organization has warned.

In its latest snapshot of the global trading system, the Geneva-based institution says it had previously expected goods trade to expand by a healthy 2.7% this year. As a result of Washington’s trade policy, it is now forecasting a 0.2% decline.

Presenting the forecasts, the WTO’s director general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said she was particularly concerned about the “decoupling” of the US and China, calling it “a phenomenon that is really worrying to me”.

She said trade between the two geopolitical rivals was expected to plunge by 81-91% without exemptions for tech products such as smartphones – saying this was “tantamount to a decoupling of the two economies” and would have, “far-reaching consequences”.

Okonjo-Iweala said the WTO was canvassing its member countries about whether to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.

In its report, the organisation says: “The outlook for global trade has deteriorated sharply due to a surge in tariffs and trade policy uncertainty.”

It had previously forecast global GDP growth of 2.8% for 2025, but now expects a weaker 2.2%.

The US has imposed tariffs of 10% on all imports, with much higher rates for China totalling 145%, and on specific sectors including cars and steel. The WTO expects the biggest impact of the policy to be a sharp decline in trade with the US – with other regions still expected to experience growth.

Trump’s far larger “reciprocal” tariffs were paused last week for 90 days after a violent reaction in financial markets. The WTO warns that if these are reimposed after the hiatus, it would have a much greater impact, causing a 0.8% decline in global goods trade.

If this was followed by a surge in “trade policy uncertainty” worldwide, as other countries readjust their policies in response, the WTO suggests the effects would be an even greater 1.5% fall in trade. And in this worst-case scenario, the WTO predicts even weaker global GDP growth, of just 1.7%.

After Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcement on 2 April was followed by a string of sometimes apparently contradictory statements from Washington, the WTO warns that uncertainty in itself is an important contributor to the risks of a slowdown.

“Uncertainty fosters an increased prudence in decision-making,” the WTO says, pointing to evidence that “trade policy uncertainty can, among other things, dampen business confidence, reducing business investment and thereby impairing economic growth.”

It adds: “Ultimately, the degree to which uncertainty can be managed by firms will be a key determinant of whether the positive macroeconomic momentum observed in 2024 translates into sustained global trade growth in the coming years.”

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have also warned about the potential shock to trade from a tariff war.

Ajay Banga, head of the World Bank, said growing uncertainty would lead to slower global growth than expected.

Speaking before the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington next week, he urged developing world countries to negotiate with neighbours and the US to lower tariffs, adding “the quicker we do it, the better”.

Banga said tariffs were often higher in the developing world and were associated with outsourcing jobs from industrialised countries. He argued this economic model held back the development of independent and more resilient nations.

The WTO predicts some “diversion” of trade, as Beijing seeks new markets for its goods outside the US. Chinese exports to regions outside North America are expected to expand by between 4% and 9%, in 2025.

Services trade is not directly hit by Trump’s tariffs, but the WTO expects it to be affected indirectly. “Tariff induced declines in goods trade weaken demand for related services such as transport and logistics, while broader uncertainty dampens discretionary spending on travel and slows investment-related services,” it warns.

The WTO acts as the watchdog for global trading rules, and has previously provided a forum for the negotiation of international trade deals – but its role has increasingly come into question in recent years, as the progress of globalisation has slowed.

Trump’s tariffs have been applied in complete disregard to the “most favoured nation” rule that forms the bedrock of the system overseen by the WTO – which is meant to mean that trade advantages offered to one member-country should be extended to all.

China has urged the WTO to investigate the impact of the Trump tariffs. Beijing said in a statement to the WTO last week: “Reciprocal tariffs are not – and will never be – a cure for trade imbalances. Instead, they will backfire, harming the US itself.”","Trump’s tariffs will send international trade into reverse this year, depressing global economic growth, the World Trade Organization has warned.

WASHINGTON — In addition to hitting Americans with trillions of dollars in new taxes and cratering the stock market, Donald Trump’s arbitrary tariff regime offers yet another opportunity for a president who has already shown his willingness to use his office for personal gain, critics fear.

The new tariffs, which started taking effect Saturday, already have exemptions for specific industries, establishing the precedent for corporations or even entire countries to win carve-outs for themselves.

And, government watchdogs and other experts worry, with Trump having long demonstrated a willingness to take official actions in return for private or political benefit, a vast new field of potential corruption has opened.

“There are concerns around additional graft and cronyism,” said Melinda St. Louis, global trade director at Public Citizen.

Rajeev Goel, an Illinois State University economist, co-authored a 2023 paper finding that multilateral trade agreements help fight “public sector corruption” by creating transparent, level playing fields for buying and selling goods across borders.

“The current tariffs are doing the reverse of what we studied earlier,” he said.

“If you define corruption as making side deals with the Trump administration for special exemptions, that is certain to happen on a grand scale, and may well be the intent of the tariff imposition itself,” said Bill Megginson, a finance professor at the University of Oklahoma’s business school and a co-author of a 2025 paper that studied political “distortions” of Trump’s first-term tariffs.

Trump’s White House, responding to HuffPost queries about whether he would be amenable to quid-pro-quo arrangements that benefit him in exchange for exemptions from the new tariffs, said he was only interested in helping the country.

“The only people President Trump is currying favor with are the American people who have faced the devastating consequences of backward, ‘America Last’ trade policies that have led to millions in job losses, vulnerabilities to our national security, and a weakening of our dominance,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.

Trump, though, has over the years established a history of such transactional behavior and of mixing his official duties with his personal financial interests ― actions that are the very definition of corruption. Thursday evening, for example, Trump traveled at taxpayer expense to Miami to attend a closed-door dinner for the Saudi-backed LIV golf tour — a business entity he profits from.

Trump not long ago called cryptocurrencies “a scam,” but changed his position last summer after industry leaders began making massive donations to help get him elected. As president, Trump is creating a “strategic” Bitcoin reserve, giving the U.S. government’s imprimatur to an “asset” that has zero intrinsic value. He also pardoned the creator of a website designed for the sale of drugs and other contraband after promising crypto enthusiasts he would do so if they voted for him.

In his first term, Trump pushed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to open an investigation into his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, using congressionally approved military aid as leverage. Had a federal official who did not have presidential immunity done the same thing, he would have been charged with extortion, former prosecutors have said.

And unlike previous presidents who made a point of separating themselves from their private businesses and financial holdings during their time in office, Trump has done the opposite. In his first term, his party and officials in his administration made his hotel just blocks from the White House a gathering place for meetings with both foreign and domestic interest groups. Foreign delegations would book rooms and, occasionally, even large blocks of rooms during their stays.

At one point, Trump even tried to hold the G7 summit of leaders from the world’s largest democratic economies at Doral, his troubled golf resort near the Miami airport.

Trump began his second term with an even more flagrant use of his office for his personal gain by selling a crypto “coin,” a vehicle that those seeking his favor could use to enrich him without a public trace.

Then, in office, among his first acts were to fire all the independent inspectors general at executive branch agencies and to order the Justice Department to suspend enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which made it illegal for Americans to bribe officials overseas.

“It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” Trump said.

Public Citizen’s Melinda St. Louis said that if Trump starts making exclusions to the tariffs based on appeals from well-connected businesses, it will be no different from what he did in the first term.

That, in fact, is the topic of the paper Megginson and his co-authors published earlier this year titled “The Political Economy of Tariff Exemption Grants.” It found that companies requesting waivers from tariffs in Trump’s first term were twice as likely to succeed if their CEOs had donated to Republicans than if they had donated to Democrats.

“The big takeaway for us is that the U.S. institutions are not robust to an administration choosing to impose utterly complex and confusing tariffs, and then deciding to extract benefits in exchange for exemptions,” said Veljko Fotak, a finance professor at the University of Buffalo and a paper co-author.

Norm Eisen, the top ethics lawyer in Barack Obama’s White House, agreed that Trump’s tariff scheme is an easy vehicle for corruption. “By asserting these imperial whims, Trump opens himself up to unseemly influence attempts from foreign countries to try to get tariffs reversed,” Eisen said. “It can be as simple as buying his meme digital coin or as complicated as providing patronage or favors for his foreign or domestic properties. It is a grave corruption risk on top of many others that have hit.”

A report by Public Citizen last month pointed out that sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska won an exemption from Trump’s aluminum tariffs not long after Trump met privately with Deripaska’s friend, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. That waiver was reversed after a public outcry.

Indeed, even a Department of Commerce inspector general’s report in 2019 found evidence of an “unofficial appeals process” for waivers and undocumented discussions between petitioners and government officials. “We believe these issues give the perception that the Section 232 exclusion request review process is neither transparent nor objective,” the report stated.

St. Louis said the process of carve-outs in the new tariffs is already exhibiting signs of those same issues, pointing to the exemption for the fossil fuel industry — which Trump reportedly demanded come up with $1 billion for his reelection last year.

WASHINGTON — In addition to hitting Americans with trillions of dollars in new taxes and cratering the stock market, Trump’s arbitrary tariff regime offers yet another opportunity for a president who has already shown his willingness to use his office for personal gain, critics fear.

The new tariffs, which started taking effect Saturday, already have exemptions for specific industries, establishing the precedent for corporations or even entire countries to win carve-outs for themselves.

And, government watchdogs and other experts worry, with Trump having long demonstrated a willingness to take official actions in return for private or political benefit, a vast new field of potential corruption has opened.

“There are concerns around additional graft and cronyism,” said Melinda St. Louis, global trade director at Public Citizen.

Rajeev Goel, an Illinois State University economist, co-authored a 2023 paper finding that multilateral trade agreements help fight “public sector corruption” by creating transparent, level playing fields for buying and selling goods across borders.

“The current tariffs are doing the reverse of what we studied earlier,” he said.

“If you define corruption as making side deals with the Trump administration for special exemptions, that is certain to happen on a grand scale, and may well be the intent of the tariff imposition itself,” said Bill Bill Megginson, a finance professor at the University of Oklahoma’s business school and a co-author of a 2025 paper that studied political “distortions” of Trump’s first-term tariffs.

Trump’s White House, responding to HuffPost queries about whether he would be amenable to quid-pro-quo arrangements that benefit him in exchange for exemptions from the new tariffs, said he was only interested in helping the country.

“The only people President Trump is currying favor with are the American people who have faced the devastating consequences of backward, ‘America Last’ trade policies that have led to millions in job losses, vulnerabilities to our national security, and a weakening of our dominance,” White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.

Trump, though, has over the years established a history of such transactional behavior and of mixing his official duties with his personal financial interests ― actions that are the very definition of corruption. Thursday evening, for example, Trump traveled at taxpayer expense to Miami to attend a closed-door dinner for the Saudi-backed LIV golf tour — a business entity he profits from.

Trump not long ago called cryptocurrencies “a scam,” but changed his position last summer after industry leaders began making massive donations to help get him elected. As president, Trump is creating a “strategic” Bitcoin reserve, giving the U.S. government’s imprimatur to an “asset” that has zero intrinsic value. He also pardoned the creator of a website designed for the sale of drugs and other contraband after promising crypto enthusiasts he would do so if they voted for him.

In his first term, Trump pushed Ukrainian president Zelenskyy to open an investigation into his Democratic opponent, Joe Joe Biden, using congressionally approved military aid as leverage. Had a federal official who did not have presidential immunity done the same thing, he would have been charged with extortion, former prosecutors have said.

And unlike previous presidents who made a point of separating themselves from their private businesses and financial holdings during their time in office, Trump has done the opposite. In his first term, his party and officials in his administration made his hotel just blocks from the White House a gathering place for meetings with both foreign and domestic interest groups. Foreign delegations would book rooms and, occasionally, even large blocks of rooms during their stays.

At one point, Trump even tried to hold the G7 summit of leaders from the world’s largest democratic economies at Doral, his troubled golf resort near the Miami airport.

Trump began his second term with an even more flagrant use of his office for his personal gain by selling a crypto “coin,” a vehicle that those seeking his favor could use to enrich him without a public trace.

Then, in office, among his first acts were to fire all the independent inspectors general at executive branch agencies and to order the Justice Department to suspend enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which made it illegal for Americans to bribe officials overseas.

“It’s going to mean a lot more business for America,” Trump said.

Market turmoil and recession warnings have helped fuel worry about the United States economy in the aftermath of President Donald Trump’s tariff escalation -- even as key measures of the economy remain fairly strong.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week addressed the disconnect between the robust data and the dampening outlook.

“Despite heightened uncertainty and downside risks, the U.S. economy is still in a solid position,” Powell said. He said he welcomed cooling inflation and resilient hiring, but also voiced alarm about the potential effects of Trump’s tariffs.

“Life moves pretty fast,” Powell added.

Economists who spoke to ABC News said the apparent dissonance between the economy’s gloomy outlook and its clean bill of health stems largely from a quirk in economic data.

Measures of the economy like inflation and hiring are released a month after the data is gathered, and they often reflect slow-moving shifts in business or consumer behavior, the economists said. As a result, such measures can prove outdated, especially when the economy is in flux.

By contrast, the economists added, barometers of market sentiment like stock performance and consumer surveys offer an up-to-date snapshot of how participants are feeling and, in turn, where the economy may be headed.

But forecasts derived from these metrics are imperfect, they added, leaving open the possibility that signals could be overstating or underplaying the eventual effect of tariffs.

Due to the lag in economic data, the gap between solid readings and dire warnings “may be smaller than it seems,” Jesse Rothstein, a professor of public policy and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, told ABC News. “Ultimately, we’ll have to wait and see.”

Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs earlier this month set off one of the most volatile periods of stock trading in U.S. history. The uneasiness roiling markets also manifested in shopper surveys, one of which last week showed worse attitudes about the economy than at any point during the Great Recession.

Many economists expect Trump’s tariffs to hike costs and slow growth, since importers burdened by the tax are expected to raise prices for consumers, who may opt to curtail spending and ratchet down the main engine of U.S. economic activity.

“Consumer sentiment is a leading economic indicator – it’s saying people are worried now and they’re going to stop buying,” Frederick Floss, an economics professor at Buffalo State University, told ABC News.

Plus, Rothstein said, the stock market isn't merely a measure of sentiment. ""People are putting their money where their mouth is,"" he said.

For now, the economy remains in solid shape by several top measures.

The unemployment rate stands at a historically low level. Job growth remains robust, though it has slowed from previous highs. Meanwhile, inflation cooled in March, putting price increases well below a peak attained in 2022, fresh data last week showed.

Data remains unavailable for the level of inflation and hiring in April, meaning the readings so far predate Trump's tariff escalation.

A report on gross domestic product to be released at the end of this month will offer the first gauge of economic growth at the outset of this year. The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.4% over the final three months of 2024, which marked solid growth.

“The U.S. economy is quite resilient,” Matias Vernengo, a professor of economics at Bucknell University, told ABC News. “Inflation is low, the economy is still growing at a relatively quick pace.”

Still, Vernengo said, some of the purported strength may be a mirage because the data is “retrospective.”

“I would be cautious,” Vernengo said, pointing to the possibility of a tariff-induced recession. “If you have to look at the objective data, it doesn’t mean it won’t happen -- just that it hasn’t happened yet.”

Recession fears are mounting on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs earlier this month raised the odds of a recession within the next year from 35% to 45%. On Tuesday, J.P. Morgan hiked its odds of a recession occurring in 2025 to 60%.

The warnings of a downturn echo forecasts made during the latter years of Joe Biden's administration, but a recession never came to pass. In that case, sour consumer sentiment also served as a major source of fear.

The outlook has changed significantly since the Biden administration, however, some economists said.

Biden’s policies helped bring about an economic recovery, though the fallout risked a severe bout of inflation, Vernengo said, while Trump’s tariffs have stoked uncertainty and hiked taxes for some corporations.

“Trump has created a storm,” Vernengo said. “It will very likely have consequences.”","Apparent economic strength owes in part to a lag in data, experts said.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly touted what he calls the return of manufacturing to the United States, hailing companies that have vowed to pour large amounts of money into making everything from computer chips to cars in America.

But announcements are easy to make. In the long term, why would companies and other countries decide to invest in the US, which has upended the global economic order in just weeks? The United States moved from a stable economy, a trusted partner in trade agreements and global security, to a source of confusion and doubt in mere weeks after Trump assumed office on January 20.

Perhaps no one has put it more bluntly than Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, on Wednesday, when she said to a news outlet in Germany: “The West as we knew it no longer exists.”

In other words: The United States isn’t the only trade game in town.

Sure, the US is the world’s biggest economy, with a gross domestic product of almost $30 trillion. But China, the world’s No. 2 economy, is at about $18 trillion, according to the World Bank. And the total value of the European Union’s economy is around 17 trillion euros, or about $19 trillion.

“We have 166 members in the organization. US trade is 13% of world trade. That means that there’s 87% of world trade happening between the other members of the WTO,” Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organization, told CNN’s Richard Quest on Wednesday.

Trump has repeatedly claimed that other countries have been “ripping off” the United States for years, despite American growth rates that have been the envy of the developed world. So far, he has imposed 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel; 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada that aren’t compliant with a free-trade agreement; a massive 145% duty on Chinese imports; a 25% tariff on cars, with separate tariffs on auto parts coming at a later date; and a 10% baseline tariffs on all US imports.

But those numbers don’t quite capture the whiplash-inducing speed with which Trump has levied tariffs, then walked them back, only to announce more tariffs, with another policy change soon after. The constantly changing playing field has made it even more difficult for businesses and nations to contend with the new policies.

The tariffs in place now “will likely slow global economic growth significantly,” Moody’s Ratings said in a recent report. “And the inconsistent approach to policymaking has undermined confidence globally.”

The changes have been not only swift but also deep.

“These are very fundamental policy changes,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday. “There isn’t a modern experience of how to think about this.”

His comments sent US stock markets slumping, with investors clearly uneasy about what it means when a usually staid central banker suggests the world economic order is being turned topsy-turvy. (Trump ripped Powell on social media the next day, ostensibly for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, writing: “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!”)

Already, as CNN’s Allison Morrow points out, companies and individuals are seeing real-world effects, from chipmaker Nvidia to aircraft maker (and top US exporter) Boeing, all the way to people shopping for cheap clothing or makeup hauls on Temu and Shein.

China, for its part, has been diversifying its trading relationships beyond the US since its trade war with the US during Trump’s first administration. China’s exports to the US dropped from 19.2% of its total overseas shipments in 2018, to 14.7% in 2024, said Sheng Laiyun, deputy director of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, at a news conference Wednesday. Reuters reported last week that Beijing is trying to strengthen trading with the EU, despite the occasional past spat over cheap goods and trade flows.

When asked by a reporter on Thursday if he was worried about China cozying up to US allies, Trump denied the possibility. “No, no,” he said. “Nobody can compete with us, nobody.”

But China isn’t alone in distancing itself from the US. Many Canadians have already canceled trips to the US to boycott Trump’s tariff policy. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney last week posted on social media about speaking with von der Leyen.

“Throughout our history, Canada and Europe have worked together to build up our economies and bolster our shared security,” he wrote. “In this time of global uncertainty, we’re focused on making our relationship even stronger.”

Von der Leyen echoed those comments Wednesday, noting that more governments, including Canada, Mexico and India, have said they want to work more with the EU.

“Everyone is asking for more trade with Europe — and it’s not just about economic ties,” she said. “It is also about establishing common rules and it is about predictability. Europe is known for its predictability and reliability, which is once again starting to be seen as something very valuable.”

Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, pressed for European unity ahead of Trump’s April 2 announcement on so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.

“I consider it a moment when we can decide together to take our destiny into our own hands, and I think it is a march to independence,” she told France Inter radio.","CNN —

16 April 2025 Share Save Charlotte Edwards Business reporter, BBC News Share Save

EPA WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called US-China relations ""really worrying"" at a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has forecast that global trade will fall this year because of US President Donald Trump's tariffs. It added ""severe downside risks"", including reciprocal tariffs and political uncertainty, could lead to an even sharper decline in global goods trade. ""The decline is expected to be particularly steep in North America,"" the WTO said, forecasting trade to drop by more than a tenth in that region. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director general, called the ""decoupling"" of the US and China ""a phenomenon that is really worrying to me"".

The WTO previously expected global goods trade to expand by 2.7% in 2025 but it now forecasts it will fall by 0.2%. Chief economist Ralph Ossa said: ""Tariffs are a policy lever with wide-ranging, and often unintended consequences. ""Our simulations show that trade policy uncertainty has a significant dampening effect on trade flows, reducing exports and weakening economic activity,"" he added.

A baseline tariff of 10% on almost all foreign imports to the US kicked in on 5 April, although some countries and goods are exempt. China has a much higher tariff, which now totals 145% on most goods. The US stock market slid on opening on Wednesday with the big indexes falling amid the ongoing uncertainty. Despite the prediction of plunging trade with the US, the WTO expects some regions will still see trade growth. It said Asia and Europe were still projected to post modest growth in both exports and imports this year. ""The collective contribution to world trade growth of other regions would also remain positive,"" the WTO report said. For the first time, the report contains a forecast for services trade - which is when countries buy and sell services to each other instead of goods. This is common in industries such as tourism or finance where nothing physical is shipped but a service is provided. The WTO forecasts services trade to grow by 4% in 2025, which is around one percentage point less than expected.

Trump's tariff announcements and climbdowns","US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO

EPA WTO chief Ngozi Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called US-China relations ""really worrying"" at a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has forecast that global trade will fall this year because of US President Trump's tariffs. It added ""severe downside risks"", including reciprocal tariffs and political uncertainty, could lead to an even sharper decline in global goods trade. ""The decline is expected to be particularly steep in North America,"" the WTO said, forecasting trade to drop by more than a tenth in that region. Ngozi Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the WTO director general, called the ""decoupling"" of the US and China ""a phenomenon that is really worrying to me"".

The WTO previously expected global goods trade to expand by 2.7% in 2025 but it now forecasts it will fall by 0.2%. Chief economist Ralph Ossa said: ""Tariffs are a policy lever with wide-ranging, and often unintended consequences. ""Our simulations show that trade policy uncertainty has a significant dampening effect on trade flows, reducing exports and weakening economic activity,"" he added. Also on Wednesday, the UN trade and development body, UNCTAD, released its own report which forecasts global growth to slow to 2.3% in 2025 due to escalating trade tensions and uncertainty. It said the projection was below ""the 2.5% threshold widely viewed as signalling a global recession"". Tariffs will hit US economy and raise prices, says Fed boss

Trump's tariff announcements and climbdowns"
Tariffs,Forbes,Center,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2025/04/08/trumps-net-worth-drops-500-million-as-tariffs-upend-global-economy/,Y,"It has been a disorienting week for investors as Donald Trump works to reshape the world's economy, wiping out trillions of dollars in the process. Jamel Toppin for forbes

Tariffs seem like simple tools, but they often come with unexpected repercussions. Just ask the president, whose fortune dropped a half billion dollars in a few days.

D onald Trump fired the first shots in a global trade war last week, inflicting damage on all sorts of people—including himself. On April 2, the day Trump rolled out his plan for sweeping tariffs, Forbes pegged his net worth at $4.7 billion. Less than a week later, it’s down to an estimated $4.2 billion, as the value of his public stock and private holdings fall in tandem with the broader market.

Trump’s biggest loss comes from his most valuable asset, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which declined 8% over the last three trading days, hitting its lowest price since October. His stake, worth $2.2 billion Wednesday, now sits at $2 billion. The roughly $170 million hit represents only the beginning of his problems.

Trump’s commercial real estate holdings have fallen an estimated $90 million, assuming they’ve experienced similar haircuts as publicly traded commercial property companies. Shares of Vornado Realty Trust—the firm that partners with Trump in two of his most valuable buildings, 1290 Avenue of the Americas in New York and 555 California Street in San Francisco—dropped 14% from the time of Trump’s announcement to the end of the day Monday. The stock price of another big New York City real estate firm, SL Green, fell 15%. Trump’s portfolio, including the Vornado properties, Trump Tower and 40 Wall Street, is now worth an estimated $570 million, down from $660 million last week.

Golf properties are losing value, too. Many of the balls, clubs and shirts in pro shops come from overseas. The real threat to Trump’s portfolio, however, is the possibility of belt tightening. Club members might cut back on weddings, lavish dining or even memberships. “If you hit a recession, your wife looks over at you and says ‘What the [heck] are we doing with this expensive club membership?’” explains one industry insider.

There are no publicly traded companies quite like Trump’s collection of golf clubs, but the closest comparables point to trouble. Shares of highly priced leisure businesses, such as Vail Resorts and Soho House, are down more than 15% since Wednesday. Topgolf Callaway Brands, which manufactures clubs and runs golf venues, is down 15%, as well. A similar decline at Trump’s golf courses would shave another $70 million off his net worth.

Hospitality assets aren’t positioned any better. Trump’s biggest is Trump National Doral, a 643-room resort in Miami, where Saudi-connected LIV Golf just held an event, with Trump showing up shortly after announcing his tariff plans. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers says the president remains focused on the country, not his business. “President Trump implemented tariffs on countries that have been ripping us off for years to ensure Americans are better off for generations to come,” she said in a statement. “The president’s assets are in a trust managed by his children while he is working overtime to lead the country to economic prosperity.” In addition to Doral, Trump continues to own hundreds of hotel-condo units in towers in Chicago and Las Vegas. If the value of Trump’s holdings fell by, say, 16%, he would have lost another $65 million. His much-smaller licensing-and-management business might have shed another $15 million on top of that.

Residential real estate also declined dramatically, with shares of four publicly traded apartment holders down an average of 13%. Trump owns dozens of units inside buildings he developed years ago. Trim that portfolio, and his net worth falls another $20 million or so. His most protected assets might be his many trophies, like the penthouse atop Trump Tower and Mar-a-Lago. Dana Koch, a luxury agent in Palm Beach, says those sorts of assets operate in a different atmosphere than publicly traded stocks. “This is even more finite and more scarce,” he says. Nudge the trophies down by, say, 5%, or half the decline of the broader market, and Trump is out another $32 million.

Cash typically provides respite in times like these. According to Trump’s latest financial disclosure report, he holds a portfolio of diversified bonds and a smattering of equity positions, including a $5 to $25 million stake in private-credit firm Blue Owl Capital, down 22% since Wednesday. After filing that disclosure in August, Trump received two massive windfalls via cryptocurrency ventures. First came World Liberty Financial, a project that promised a “financial revolution” and funneled nearly $400 million to the president and his family. Then came sales of the $TRUMP coin, which probably supplied at least another $175 million before taxes.

The issue for the president is that he may have stored some of those proceeds in cryptocurrencies, notoriously fickle assets. First son Eric Trump publicly touted Ether in February, telling his Twitter followers it was “a great time to add $ETH.” The currency is down 45% since then, including an 18% drop in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariff announcement. If the president’s estimated post-tax windfall of $350 million fell by even half as much as Ether, he would be out another $32 million.

Add all it up, and Trump’s losses from privately held assets appear to outweigh those from his publicly traded stock. The greatest threat to Trump is not direct tariffs on products he imports, given that his businesses don’t sell much in the way of hard goods. It’s the loss of investor confidence around the world. People rely on whims, not logic, when deciding whether to buy or ditch luxury real estate, pricy club memberships and high-flying meme stocks. The more uncertainty Trump injects into the global economy, the farther his net worth will tumble.

Tariffs,Fox Business,Lean Right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/trumps-tariffs-putting-consumers-businesses-bind-consumer-technology-association-warns,Y,"President Donald Trump's tariffs have created uncertainty over trade policy and chilled business decisions by companies in the consumer technology industry. As a result, small businesses face difficult choices, and consumers face the prospect of price hikes, an industry expert is warning.

Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told FOX Business in an interview that while some firms may be able to mitigate some of the tariff costs, others will be forced to raise prices for consumers — if they can afford the cost of the tariffs.

""Every company is going to have to make their own choices on how they deal with this. There are going to be some companies that have more ability because of their scale to spread the cost throughout their businesses, and they might have to pass those costs on through their supply chain,"" Brzytwa said.

""I think for the small businesses, it's much more difficult to do that because they may not have the resources at the moment to even pay the tariffs,"" he explained, noting about 80% of CTA's 1,200 member companies are small businesses and startups. ""If they do pay the tariffs, they're going to need to get paid back by their customers. And, so, if they raise their prices too much, they might not even have a market for the product because the tariff rates are so prohibitively high.""

HOW TRUMP'S TARIFFS COULD IMPACT THE LABOR MARKET

Brzytwa said, based on an analysis he's seen, the 145% tariffs on imported goods from China are ""so high that it will not lead to any new revenue. It will just block products from coming into the country"" as firms opt against paying the tariff to import the goods and trade volumes decline between the two countries.

""What that means for products in the United States, at least in the short- to mid-term if there's no substitution, is that there's going to be more scarcity of products, and that's going to lead to higher prices,"" he explained. ""That's just basic economics. If you create scarcity, there's going to be more demand for the remaining products that are left over, and prices are going to go up. It's not a company decision at that point. That's just a demand response.""

TRUMP ADMIN MOVES TOWARD SEMICONDUCTOR, PHARMACEUTICAL TARIFFS

Brzytwa said some companies are struggling to find new locations to manufacture their products to avoid the prohibitively high tariff cost, adding it's not economical for them to make those goods in the U.S. at the same price levels American consumers are accustomed to. That decision is complicated by the ""reciprocal"" tariffs that are temporarily 10% but will rise to individualized rates for most countries once the 90-day pause ends.

""The United States manufacturing environment doesn't support the ability of companies to make really innovative consumer technology products at affordable prices. These companies are going to go to places like Vietnam or Taiwan or Thailand or elsewhere,"" he explained. ""But if the threat of these reciprocal tariffs still persists, every decision they make is going to be undermined because at some point that tariff could come back.""

BILLIONAIRE HEDGE FUND MANAGER WARNS TARIFFS COULD TRIGGER CONDITIONS 'WORSE THAN A RECESSION'

To help provide more certainty for businesses in the consumer technology industry, Brzytwa said CTA is ""advocating for long-lasting, durable, binding, enforceable trade agreements between the United States and our allies.""

He noted that the Trump administration's trade talks are important but that it isn't clear what goals the White House has. Does it want to negotiate a bigger trade deal with Japan or strengthen the trade agreement with South Korea? He added a new free trade agreement with Vietnam would be ""very dynamic and important for the U.S. economy because Vietnam is an alternative to China,"" while a trade deal with India would serve similar purposes.

""You have to create the right conditions and environment for successful negotiation,"" Brzytwa explained. ""If these tariffs are just persisting, it's a aword of Damocles over the heads of these countries, and they may not be willing to negotiate if they know they're going to get hit with a tariff later despite negotiating an agreement with the administration.""

BIG BANK CEOS WEIGH IN ON TRUMP'S TARIFFS: 'CONSIDERABLE TURBULENCE'

Brzytwa said the spillover effects of tariffs could create a ""contagion"" that weakens other economies, which have also seen elevated levels of stock market turbulence.

""The administration should be mindful that harming countries around the world through U.S. policy choices is not in the best interest of the global economy,"" he said.

Last week, the Trump administration signaled it would create a tariff exemption for some consumer tech products like laptops and smartphones. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later said the exemptions would be short-term in nature, while President Trump subsequently said those tariffs are ""just moving to a different bucket"" and called reports about an exemption false.

""The Trump administration's decision to exclude certain consumer tech products from tariffs is long-overdue recognition that these duties hurt U.S. consumers and the economy, something CTA has warned for over a year,"" Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of CTA, said in a statement Monday.

""The tech exclusion is not a permanent solution. Unpredictability is undermining long-term investment and growth. More, high production costs and a limited skilled workforce make domestic manufacturing of consumer tech challenging.

Tariffs,The Epoch Times,Lean Right,https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/what-do-trump-tariffs-mean-for-american-consumers-5820226,Y,"The Epoch Times spoke with economists and analysts about what to expect from Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico as well as increased tariffs on China.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect on March 4, in addition to a doubling of the 10 percent universal tariff on imports from China to 20 percent.

Trump confirmed in a Truth Social post on Feb. 27 that the plan would move forward, pointing toward illicit drugs such as fentanyl being smuggled into the United States from the two neighboring countries. He said the tariffs will be in place until these countries take major steps to prevent trafficking.

“We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” Trump wrote.

Trump agreed in early February to delay the tariffs for 30 days after Canada and Mexico took measures to better secure their borders with the United States. Canada established a fentanyl czar, and Mexico deployed 10,000 Mexican national guard members to its northern border.

The U.S. president has imposed a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico, except for oil and electricity from Canada, which will be subject to a 10 percent tariff.

While Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced plans to unveil a response on March 11, Canada has already responded.

“Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow, respond with 25 per cent tariffs against $155 billion of American goods—starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days’ time,” then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement on March 3.

Trudeau said tariffs will remain until the United States withdraws its tariffs.

“While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal,” he stated.

The Epoch Times spoke with numerous experts about the tariffs’ implications for consumers.

UCLA professor Christopher Tang expects Trump’s tariff strategy to have negative economic consequences for Americans in the form of higher prices for consumer goods, including electronics, clothing, and automobiles.

“Higher prices would affect low-income households more severely because their expenditure of these goods represent a higher percentage of their income,” Tang told The Epoch Times.

Jerry Nickelsburg, adjunct professor of economics at UCLA, agrees with his colleague that the tariffs will raise prices on the affected goods.

“A tariff is a sales tax on a set of goods based on where they were produced,” he said. “This will increase the rate of inflation in the near term.”

Stewart Prest, a political science lecturer at the University of British Columbia, said consumers will feel a pinch from the tariffs.

“Goods on both sides of the border will end up getting more expensive, and the industries that were supplying markets on the other side of the border—on both sides—will suffer as a result,” he said. “And the effect will be particularly extreme in some specific sectors of the economy, such as the automotive industry in Ontario and Quebec, and in the United States.”

Meanwhile, Torsten Jaccard, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia, said it is difficult to determine who will be the winners and losers with such tariffs.

“If it is the goal of the U.S. to weaken economic allies in order to produce more goods domestically, then tariffs may succeed to some extent in accomplishing those goals,” he told The Epoch Times.

Jaccard believes that it has served the United States well to be part of a global alliance of economically stable democracies, but if Americans feel that this alliance is no longer necessary to their well-being, that is their decision to make.

“It should be noted that while the proposed tariffs will likely make life more expensive for Americans, the aggregate costs will likely be borne by Canadians. We rely on selling goods to the U.S. to a much greater extent than the U.S. relies on buying goods produced in Canada,” Jaccard said.

Jeff Ferry, chief economist emeritus at the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), said that the purpose of the tariffs is to stimulate domestic production.

“Mexico assembles approximately 3 million cars a year to ship into the U.S. market,” he said. “If you go back a few decades, those cars were assembled in the U.S. So, if we put a 25 percent tariff on Mexico, it’s very likely that some—not all, but some—of that car production will, over time, migrate back to the U.S.”

Ferry said other examples are in the steel and aluminum industry.

“Mexican companies have increased shipments into the U.S. market in spite of agreements the U.S. and Mexican governments made back in around 2019 to limit those shipments,” he said. “Mexico has exceeded those limits.”

A 25 percent tariff should put some downward pressure on the volume of shipments of steel and aluminum coming in from Mexico, according to Ferry.

“There’s other industries as well, where Mexican exports into the U.S. have led to Americans losing jobs. So it’s very likely that a 25 percent tariff will reverse some of that trend—not all of it, but some of it,” he said.

Ferry said tariffs have the potential to bring in several trillion dollars over 10 years. According to a simulation run by the CPA, a 10 percent global tariff on all U.S. imports would generate sufficient funds to finance a tax cut worth $1,200 to every low-income U.S. household.

“We can use tariffs to refund $1,200 per household each year, and do it to everybody, excluding the very rich. So, it’s actually a progressive tax refund. In other words, it’s benefiting the poor more than the rich. That’s definitely a viable possibility,” he said.

It’s a proposal that he urges Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to strongly consider.

Gerald Celente, publisher of Trends Journal, views tariffs as a positive for the United States under one condition: that Trump sticks to his proposal to eliminate the income tax.

“We believe that in some aspects, tariffs will be very beneficial for America,” Celente told The Epoch Times. “The reasons being that if he puts tariffs on, will he do away with income tax? Because when we had tariffs, we didn’t have income tax, and they didn’t invent that until Woodrow Wilson created the Federal Reserve, brought us into World War I, and gave us the IRS and federal income tax. We didn’t have it back then.”

Celente said that if Trump eliminates the federal income tax, consumers will have more money to spend, which will be good for the U.S. economy.

“So it’s very positive for that reason,” he said.

Celente also thinks that tariffs could help bring manufacturing back to the United States.

“Once upon a time, America used to be a manufacturing nation,” he said. “Now two-thirds of our GDP is consumer spending, and only 11 percent [is] manufacturing.”

Celente relayed a story of how, when one of his aunts died, he received dishes made by the company Syracuse China.

“They were made in Syracuse, New York,” he said. “We had manufacturing all over the country. But when we started exporting manufacturing—first with NAFTA and then to China with the World Trade Organization—wages went down.”

Manufacturing pays a much higher percentage of revenue as wages than does the service sector, he said. The service sector jobs left over after the loss of manufacturing jobs pay very low wages.

“On that level it would be very positive, but it’s going to take time, if they do it properly,” Celente said.","The Epoch Times spoke with economists and analysts about what to expect from Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico as well as increased tariffs on China.

President Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico went into effect on March 4, in addition to a doubling of the 10 percent universal tariff on imports from China to 20 percent.

Trump confirmed in a Truth Social post on Feb. 27 that the plan would move forward, pointing toward illicit drugs such as fentanyl being smuggled into the United States from the two neighboring countries. He said the tariffs will be in place until these countries take major steps to prevent trafficking.

“We cannot allow this scourge to continue to harm the USA, and therefore, until it stops, or is seriously limited, the proposed TARIFFS scheduled to go into effect on MARCH FOURTH will, indeed, go into effect, as scheduled,” Trump wrote.

Trump agreed in early February to delay the tariffs for 30 days after Canada and Mexico took measures to better secure their borders with the United States. Canada established a fentanyl czar, and Mexico deployed 10,000 Mexican national guard members to its northern border.

The U.S. president has imposed a 25 percent tariff on Canada and Mexico, except for oil and electricity from Canada, which will be subject to a 10 percent tariff.

While Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced plans to unveil a response on March 11, Canada has already responded.

“Should American tariffs come into effect tonight, Canada will, effective 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow, respond with 25 per cent tariffs against $155 billion of American goods—starting with tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods immediately, and tariffs on the remaining $125 billion on American products in 21 days’ time,” then-Prime Minister Justin Justin Trudeau said in a statement on March 3.

Justin Trudeau said tariffs will remain until the United States withdraws its tariffs.

“While we urge the U.S. administration to reconsider their tariffs, Canada remains firm in standing up for our economy, our jobs, our workers, and for a fair deal,” he stated.

The Epoch Times spoke with numerous experts about the tariffs’ implications for consumers.

UCLA professor Christopher Christopher Tang expects Trump’s tariff strategy to have negative economic consequences for Americans in the form of higher prices for consumer goods, including electronics, clothing, and automobiles.

“Higher prices would affect low-income households more severely because their expenditure of these goods represent a higher percentage of their income,” Christopher Tang told The Epoch Times.

Jerry Nickelsburg, adjunct professor of economics at UCLA, agrees with his colleague that the tariffs will raise prices on the affected goods.

“A tariff is a sales tax on a set of goods based on where they were produced,” he said. “This will increase the rate of inflation in the near term.”

Stewart Prest, a political science lecturer at the University of British Columbia, said consumers will feel a pinch from the tariffs.

“Goods on both sides of the border will end up getting more expensive, and the industries that were supplying markets on the other side of the border—on both sides—will suffer as a result,” he said. “And the effect will be particularly extreme in some specific sectors of the economy, such as the automotive industry in Ontario and Quebec, and in the United States.”

Meanwhile, Jaccard, an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia, said it is difficult to determine who will be the winners and losers with such tariffs.

“If it is the goal of the U.S. to weaken economic allies in order to produce more goods domestically, then tariffs may succeed to some extent in accomplishing those goals,” he told The Epoch Times.

Jaccard believes that it has served the United States well to be part of a global alliance of economically stable democracies, but if Americans feel that this alliance is no longer necessary to their well-being, that is their decision to make.

“It should be noted that while the proposed tariffs will likely make life more expensive for Americans, the aggregate costs will likely be borne by Canadians. We rely on selling goods to the U.S. to a much greater extent than the U.S. relies on buying goods produced in Canada,” Jaccard said.

Ferry, chief economist emeritus at the Coalition for a Prosperous America (CPA), said that the purpose of the tariffs is to stimulate domestic production.

“Mexico assembles approximately 3 million cars a year to ship into the U.S. market,” he said. “If you go back a few decades, those cars were assembled in the U.S. So, if we put a 25 percent tariff on Mexico, it’s very likely that some—not all, but some—of that car production will, over time, migrate back to the U.S.”

Ferry said other examples are in the steel and aluminum industry.

“Mexican companies have increased shipments into the U.S. market in spite of agreements the U.S. and Mexican governments made back in around 2019 to limit those shipments,” he said. “Mexico has exceeded those limits.”

A 25 percent tariff should put some downward pressure on the volume of shipments of steel and aluminum coming in from Mexico, according to Ferry.

“There’s other industries as well, where Mexican exports into the U.S. have led to Americans losing jobs. So it’s very likely that a 25 percent tariff will reverse some of that trend—not all of it, but some of it,” he said.

Ferry said tariffs have the potential to bring in several trillion dollars over 10 years. According to a simulation run by the CPA, a 10 percent global tariff on all U.S. imports would generate sufficient funds to finance a tax cut worth $1,200 to every low-income U.S. household.

“We can use tariffs to refund $1,200 per household each year, and do it to everybody, excluding the very rich. So, it’s actually a progressive tax refund. In other words, it’s benefiting the poor more than the rich. That’s definitely a viable possibility,” he said.

It’s a proposal that he urges Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to strongly consider.

Celente, publisher of Trends Journal, views tariffs as a positive for the United States under one condition: that Trump sticks to his proposal to eliminate the income tax.

“We believe that in some aspects, tariffs will be very beneficial for America,” Celente told The Epoch Times. “The reasons being that if he puts tariffs on, will he do away with income tax? Because when we had tariffs, we didn’t have income tax, and they didn’t invent that until Woodrow Wilson created the Federal Reserve, brought us into World War I, and gave us the IRS and federal income tax. We didn’t have it back then.”

Celente said that if Trump eliminates the federal income tax, consumers will have more money to spend, which will be good for the U.S. economy.

“So it’s very positive for that reason,” he said.

Celente also thinks that tariffs could help bring manufacturing back to the United States.

“Once upon a time, America used to be a manufacturing nation,” he said. “Now two-thirds of our GDP is consumer spending, and only 11 percent [is] manufacturing.”

Celente relayed a story of how, when one of his aunts died, he received dishes made by the company Syracuse China.

“On that level it would be very positive, but it’s going to take time, if they do it properly,” Celente said."
Tariffs,Zero Hedge,Lean Right,https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/tariffs,Y,"Authored by Peter Tchir via Academy Securities,

The “Liberation Day” Tariffs announced at the Rose Garden last week went into effect as of 12:01 am. The tariffs on China have been increased since then, as China already retaliated by increasing their tariffs. I, like many refer to them as the “Liberation Day” tariffs, as that is a talking point that seems to appeal to the President and avoids calling them “reciprocal” which they are not.

There have been some interesting “surprises” overnight.

U.S. stock futures dropped between 2% and 3% a little after midnight but are now down less than 1% or even in positive in some cases (depending on whether you focus on the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100 futures). They are moving rapidly.

European stock markets are down 2.5% to 3% across the board.

What is interesting though, is that Chinese ETF’s (KWEB, FXI) are up over 5%.

We will come back to stocks, but bonds were the big story overnight!

If you were up last night waiting to see if there was a last-minute reprieve, your social media likely got overwhelmed with stories about the bond market – with the U.S. longer dated maturities being the focal point.

The 30-year bond briefly breached 5%. The always important 10-year yield rose above 4.5% as yields marched incessantly higher from around 10 pm until just after midnight. They are currently back to 4.37%, about 7 bps higher than where they closed.

The yield story is the biggest, so here is our take on what happened:

Some large and relentless volumes went through during a period of low liquidity. Why would anyone dump treasuries overnight when the market has limited liquidity relative to the U.S. hours? Large foreign or off-shore firms all have desks to trade treasuries during U.S. hours, so it was a bit weird. Leads me to think someone either was trying to “make a statement” or someone was trying to push markets and trigger stops (seems plausible). So in any case, while the move was eye-opening, I dismiss some of it, as it seems to have been done with intention.

To a large degree, this was a global phenomenon . Most major countries (except for Germany – which is the EU “safe haven”) moved higher. Though not to the extent the U.S. did and certainly not with the same level of focus from market watchers.

Could this be foreign selling of bonds ? China has come up as a culprit in the selling. Maybe other countries were selling bonds overnight to “hurt” the U.S., but that doesn’t seem that likely. As mentioned already, anyone with size, probably does the bulk of their trading during U.S. hours . I cannot think of many entities who have large exposure to U.S. bonds (large enough to move markets) that doesn’t transact primarily during U.S. hours. So I’m not sure this theory holds much water for the overnight move. Central banks, tend to hold treasuries with maturities of 5 years and in. It has been awhile since I did the digging on this (the obvious TIC data pages just show “short-term” of less than 1 year and “long-term” as longer than 1 year), but that was what I found last time. I think it was during the European debt crisis, so need to go through my notes, when I’m back at the office (am in Boston today). So I don’t think the pressure on longer maturity bonds is coming from Central Banks. Foreign Pension funds in particular do hold long dated bonds and are quite likely selling as one consequence of the administrations’ actions and threatened actions (imposing fees on holders, etc.). That is a likely source of pressure on the long end, though I would think that is mostly affecting rates during normal trading hours (which also haven’t been kind to bonds of late).

The “basis trade”. Apparently, many hedge funds (and other market participants) hold long term treasuries versus swaps. That has been unwinding of late. This makes more sense as part of last night’s moves, as this community is far more likely to have “stops” and get forced to sell, even at illiquid periods, than central banks or foreign pension funds. For now, I would attribute most of the blame on this trade/unwind.

What is helping risk assets right now?

Lots of QE and Fed emergency move chatter. I’m incredibly skeptical that anything happening in the bond market, especially in an overnight session with a once in a lifetime tariff event went into effect (at least once in my lifetime event, so far).

Countries are “begging” for deals . President Trump was speaking last night and was very aggressive in pointing out how many countries were basically begging for deals! There were no details on which countries (though he did say some “large trading counterparties” were among those “kissing his..” looking for a deal. We will see what countries and what deals . The devil will be in the detail in terms of which countries and what the deals are. On many things, tariffs alone, won’t solve trade imbalances (even if they go to zero), but it could provide a lift to markets if we get that rolling. Even after almost a week of senior administration officials discussing tariffs, it is still difficult to divine the true end goal – get tariffs to zero (probably not that hard, and didn’t necessarily need the “nuclear option”), to generate revenue (in which case they need to stay on), or to get trade balances to zero (not sure how that works with poorer countries, and despite the U.S. being “ripped off” by everyone, the U.S. does have one of the higher per capita GDP’s of any nation. Optimism is understandable, but I remain cautious on this front . China which had the largest tariffs, continues to push back and their stock market rallied further overnight (they had been down a lot too of late). So not sure we can see U.S. stocks higher as a clear “we are winning” signal.

There is still some time for a “reprieve”. My understanding is that there are exemptions for goods already at sea, if they arrive in the U.S. within the next month or so. Between what has already in inventory and what is on the way and exempt, the full impact of tariffs for countries shipping via container ships (Asia and Europe, more than Canada and Mexico) won’t be felt for another month or so. That gives time for the negotiations to occur while not being as disruptive as the headline numbers suggest.

On positioning, on a quick glance yesterday may have been a record day of inflows for ETFs. Whatever the sentiment (soft data) indicators are telling you, the hard data indicators (ETF flows) are telling us that we are positioned for a bounce. I think that trade will fail, yet again.

Corporate credit was quite weak yesterday. I will be watching the front end closely (VCSH is a good proxy for those of you not deep in the weeds of trading corporate bonds). I will be watching the discount to NAV on large corporate ETF’s like a hawk (to the extent I can watch anything in between meetings). When funds like HYG, JNK, LQD trade at a discount to NAV, it has a tendency to unleash the ETF Spiral™! I will try and send around some old notes on this, but basically my strong view is that the “arbitrage” that is created by large discounts to NAV, at the early stages of times of stress, leads to more selling! Since the arb itself is risk neutral (sell bonds, buy the ETF), some argue that it doesn’t exist, but experience tells me that when people are uncertain, that $1 of owning bonds feels far more risking than owning $1 of ETF/index and it promotes more selling.

Credit could turn today and perform well.

The Fed could indicate some interest in supporting markets.

We could see some details on potential deals.

Any and all of those would be positive, but I don’t think that it will be enough and am still extremely cautious on risk assets here.

I don’t mind buying some bonds here, even with the potential for foreign selling, but not until after the auctions!

Good luck and welcome to the post Liberation Day tariff world (which, as you can tell, I still don’t think the market is fully pricing in the risks).

Also, as last minute addition, changing correlations (like stocks and bonds both moving down together) tends to cause de-grossing (cutting positions) in any sort of strategy that relies on cross asset correlations (from true Risk Parity to Risk Parity Lite strategies, like 60/40 funds).","Authored by Peter Tchir via Academy Securities,

Filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, the lawsuit challenges Trump’s use of emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on imports from countries worldwide.



""Once again, Democrats like Letitia James are prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote exclusively to Fox News Digital. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing—both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.""



The 12 states, however, argue that the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and tariffs, and that IEEPA was never intended to authorize trade policy on this scale.

LONGTIME TRUMP FOE LETITIA JAMES REVIEWING POSSIBLE INSIDER TRADING OVER PRESIDENT'S TARIFF PAUSE

""President Trump’s reckless tariffs have skyrocketed costs for consumers and unleashed economic chaos across the country,"" said Gov. Kathy Hochul. ""New York is standing up to fight back against the largest federal tax hike in American history. Attorney General James and I are partnering on this litigation on behalf of New York consumers, because we can't let President Trump push our country into a recession.""



""The president does not have the power to raise taxes on a whim,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. ""His tariffs are unlawful and, if not stopped, they will lead to more inflation, unemployment, and economic damage.""

Since February 2025, Trump has signed multiple executive orders imposing new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and nearly all other U.S. trading partners.

The administration cited national emergencies as the basis for the tariffs, including drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and unfair trade practices. The states in the lawsuit claim the president's justifications are vague and legally insufficient.

The IEEPA, enacted in 1977, allows presidents to respond to specific international threats, such as terrorism or hostile foreign actors. But according to the lawsuit, no president in the 48 years since its passage has used it to impose tariffs.

GOP LAWMAKER TOUTS $19M TRUMP TARIFF SUCCESS STORY IN HER DISTRICT: 'NEW MODEL FOR AMERICAN MANUFACTURING'

The complaint argues that the new tariffs were imposed without congressional approval or the necessary legal findings to justify sweeping trade actions.



The lawsuit also claims that tariffs are not connected to any specific ""unusual and extraordinary"" threat, as required under IEEPA, which the Trump administration cited as its authority. The states claim the tariffs will significantly raise consumer prices, drive inflation, lead to job losses, and create widespread economic instability.

The legal challenge doesn’t just focus on economics. It argues the tariffs are unconstitutional because they usurp congressional authority over taxes and trade. The lawsuit also claims the administration’s shifting policy — which they claim is often modified by executive orders or social media — has created chaos in trade and financial markets.

Supporters of the Trump administration say the tariffs are a bold move to protect American industries and correct longstanding trade imbalances.

At a February 2025 press conference, President Trump said, ""We took in hundreds of billions of dollars [with past tariffs]… It’s going to make our country rich,"" framing the measures as a continuation of his America First economic agenda.

But the lawsuit paints a different picture of legal overreach and a lack of transparency. It argues that if President Trump's actions are allowed to stand, any future president could impose taxes under the label of emergency authority, bypassing Congress entirely.

Gov. Hochul and Attorney General James, both vocal critics of the Trump administration, have frequently clashed with the president over a range of issues, from immigration to environmental policy. This latest lawsuit marks another high-profile confrontation.

Alongside New York, the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont have joined the case.

At a February 2025 press conference, President Trump said, ""We took in hundreds of billions of dollars [with past tariffs]… It’s going to make our country rich,"" framing the measures as a continuation of his America First economic agenda.

But the lawsuit paints a different picture of legal overreach and a lack of transparency. It argues that if President Trump's actions are allowed to stand, any future president could impose taxes under the label of emergency authority, bypassing Congress entirely.

Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both vocal critics of the Trump administration, have frequently clashed with the president over a range of issues, from immigration to environmental policy. This latest lawsuit marks another high-profile confrontation.

Alongside New York, the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Vermont have joined the case.

The coalition is asking the court to block further enforcement of the tariffs and declare the orders invalid under both the Constitution and federal law."
NCAA Basketball,The Guardian,Left,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/07/florida-houston-march-madness-final-ncaa-tournament,N,"The Gators looked cooked. Down 12. Their All-American guard scoreless. The crowd inside a hangar-like 70,000-seat football stadium, just 198 miles down the road from the University of Houston campus, was a deafening sea of scarlet red.

And yet Florida found a way. In one of the most dramatic NCAA men’s championship games in recent memory, the Gators and Walter Clayton Jr overcame Houston’s suffocating defense to pull off an astonishing 65–63 victory on Monday night – a national title game thriller not put to bed until Florida’s own defense sealed it at the buzzer.

Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he’ll be remembered for most was the final moment: sprinting at Houston’s Emanuel Sharp, who was trying to spot up for a potential game-winning three. Clayton’s closeout forced Sharp to stop mid-motion, and in that moment of hesitation, Sharp dropped the ball. He couldn’t pick it up again without traveling. It bounced away while the clock ticked to zero and the Gators stormed the court in celebration.

“Our motto is, we all can go,” said Clayton, whose 713 points this year broke the program’s single-season record. “We’ve got a team full of guys that can go. It ain’t just about me. My team held me down until I was able to put the ball in the basket. Shout out to them boys.”

Florida (36–4) claimed their third NCAA men’s basketball title and first since 2007, completing a postseason run fueled by resilience, timely shot-making and relentless defense. The Gators trailed for 38 minutes and 43 seconds overall and hadn’t led since 8–6 until the final minute, when Alijah Martin calmly hit two free throws with 46.5 seconds remaining to give them a 64–63 lead. Then came a series of plays that flipped the script on college basketball’s stingiest defense, the best in the country by any metric.

Houston (35–5), seeking their first championship in the program’s 80-year history, were undone by Florida’s defense down the stretch. After Martin’s free throws, the Gators lured Sharp into a triple-team in the corner. Will Richard knocked the ball off Sharp’s leg and out of bounds. Florida added one more point at the line, then set up for one final stop. They’d get it.

“We did what we did all year,” Florida coach Todd Golden said. “We stayed the course. We have the best backcourt in America. I think we have the best frontcourt in America. And like we’ve done all year, we made plays when we needed them the most. We guarded our butts off down the stretch. [We] made every 50-50 winning play.”

The first half wasn’t pretty. In fact, it was downright brutal for stretches. Nothing came easy – not for either side – with each team missing their first seven three-point attempts. Clayton, Florida’s electric combo guard, was held scoreless after back-to-back 30-point outbursts against Texas Tech in the Elite Eight and Auburn on Saturday night, harassed by a rotating crew of Cougar defenders and denied any space. The Gators coughed up nine turnovers (to Houston’s two), their frontcourt got pushed around and their offense sputtered for long stretches. And somehow, they trailed by just three at the intermission.

Houston then opened the second half with an 11–2 run, pushing the lead to 42–30 with just under 16 minutes left. At that point, Houston’s win probability soared past 90%. Florida looked rattled. The building – filled with red – spiked to ear-splitting volumes as the Cougars landed one body blow after another.

But the Gators punched back. Clayton finally got going with a pair of three-point plays that helped Florida claw within striking distance. He hit his only three-pointer with 6:42 left, part of a second-half surge that included seven assists and multiple feeds to Thomas Haugh and Alex Condon for easy baskets. By then Houston’s offense was in a tailspin and the Gators were gaining confidence.

Condon and Haugh combined for 18 points and 13 rebounds. Martin chipped in nine and made all four of his free throws. Florida’s depth and composure made the difference.

The Cougars were led by LJ Cryer’s game-high 19 points and Sharp’s nine off the bench, but they missed their last four field goals and were held scoreless over the final 1:29. Jamal Shead’s pull-up jumper clanged off the front rim with 16 seconds to go and Sharp’s botched final look sealed their fate. After committing four turnovers in the first 36:35, they gave it away five times in the final 3:24 including each of their final four possessions.

Instead of becoming the oldest head coach to win a national title at 69, the Cougars’ Kelvin Sampson watched Golden – just 39 – become the youngest since North Carolina State’s Jim Valvano, whose own shock victory came at Houston’s expense in 1983.

Florida become the 10th different school with at least three national titles, joining UCLA (11), Kentucky (eight), North Carolina (six), Connecticut (six), Duke (five), Indiana (five), Kansas (four), Louisville and Villanova (three apiece).

For the Gators, it capped a wild ride: a second-round win over two-time defending champions UConn, a tough Elite Eight win over Texas Tech and an overtime classic in the Final Four against Southeastern Conference rivals Auburn. Each time, the Gators made it through. Same for Monday’s finale – a heart-stopper that featured 12 ties, staunch defense and three lead changes in the final 90 seconds – they completed one final comeback.

And while Richard’s hot start and Martin’s clutch free throws were critical, the game came down to Clayton: the guy who couldn’t buy a bucket early, then made the game’s defining play without one. And a short drive down Interstate 10 from Houston, it was the Gators and not the Cougars who cut down the nets.","The Gators looked cooked. Down 12. Their All-American guard scoreless.

Big 12 champion Houston and Florida will meet in the national championship game in the Alamodome to wrap up only the second NCAA Tournament when all the No. 1 seeds made it to the Final Four.

Still, this title game matchup is quite a surprise, and features two teams that haven’t been this far in a long time. BetMGM Sportsbook had Florida listed as a 1 1/2-point favorite.

The Cougars (35-4) won their semifinal game Saturday night by overcoming a 14-point deficit in the final eight minutes for a 70-67 stunner over Duke and freshman sensation Cooper Flagg, the AP national player of the year.

That was after Florida (35-4), with AP All-America guard Walter Clayton Jr. scoring 34 points, only had to come back from eight points down after halftime in its 79-73 win over SEC rival Auburn.

Houston, which has an 18-game winning streak, is in its first national championship game since back-to-back appearances in 1983 and 1984 during the Phi Slama Jama era.

This is Florida’s first since winning its back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007 under Billy Donovan. The Gators, with third-year coach Todd Golden, have an 11-game winning streak since a loss at Georgia at the end of February.

“It’s pretty incredible,” Golden said. “In three years, been fortunate to build a great staff that is aligned, that works really hard for each other. Then we’ve just accumulated a great group of guys on our roster. It took a little bit to get all these pieces together. But to a man, they all pull the same direction.”

The Cougars have won 30 of their last 31 games since two overtime losses over three days in a tournament in Las Vegas at the end of November. Their only loss since was 82-81 in OT on Feb. 1 to Texas Tech, an Elite Eight team. Their other loss this season: 74-69 to Auburn in the second game.

Coach Kelvin Sampson and Houston also made the Final Four four years ago, losing to eventual champion Baylor in the national semifinal in the NCAA tourney in a bubble in Indianapolis because of the COVID-19 pandemic. L.J. Cryer, now Houston’s leading scorer, was a freshman for the Bears on that title team.

Now the Cougars will play for a championship after being the first Texas team to make a Final Four held in the Lone Star State — after so much talk about the other teams that made it to San Antonio.

“This whole year, I’ve been trying to stay off social media and stuff like that. I really don’t see those type of things,” Cryer said. “I try just to listen to coach Sampson, and he believed we were the best team in the tournament, so that’s the only person I listened to.”

NCAA Basketball,Slate,Left,https://slate.com/culture/2025/04/houston-florida-college-basketball-game-ncaa-winner.html,N,"Florida is as deserving a national champion as any NCAA competition has ever had. The Gators survived the crucible of the hardest conference in college basketball history, an SEC that placed a record 14 teams in the NCAA Tournament. It won the conference tournament, and then it won an NCAA Tournament that featured all four No. 1 seeds making the Final Four. To even get that far, they had to beat a UConn program that had won the previous two national championships. Every path to a title is brutal, but Florida’s is on the shortlist of the most brutal ever. The team that came back from 12 points down in the second half in Monday’s title game to beat Houston 65-63 did not get any breaks along the way.

If you are a Florida fan gator-chomping in celebration, you may now use your two previous championship rings from this century to plug your ears. You’ll soon have another one for your finger. Have you plugged them? Good. This was an ugly championship, the opposite of a feel-good story if you are anyone other than a Florida fan. We can say on the one hand that Florida has mastered the new world of college basketball—and acknowledge on the other that the Gators’ title is a sign of good days gone by.

That judgment isn’t about the Gators’ head coach, though it’s worth mentioning his story up front, if only because the TV broadcasts of Florida’s games down the stretch almost never did. Todd Golden, the 39-year-old in his third year leading the program, was the subject of a preseason Title IX complaint that included detailed allegations that he stalked and sexually harassed female students. The university said it dismissed its investigation of Golden in January after finding no evidence that the coach had violated Title IX. The school did not say more than that, not that it could, given the circumstances.

Golden was able to move on, and anyone who’d like to ignore the allegations against him will be able to do so easily. The next administrative action Florida takes with Golden will be to offer him a huge contract extension. There’s no sense in comparing the respective moralities of anyone in a college basketball game, though. Whatever your view of Golden, it shouldn’t have hinged on whether he won on Monday.

Instead, Florida’s title is a bummer on basketball terms because of what the Gators’ near-perfection represents. Golden and his staff mastered college hoops roster-building, and they did it in such a rich-getting-richer fashion that it calls into question if the NCAA Tournament you used to love is ever coming back. This is not Florida’s problem; in fact, it’s not anyone’s problem, other than the head coaches of mid-major Division I basketball teams. But it would have been a more just outcome if Duke had won the national championship by simply dominating the tournament with future No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg.

Let me explain. Every college basketball team now relies on the transfer portal for talent. Houston, the team that led Florida almost all night on Monday before frittering the game away, does it. Duke, the program that recruits high school players better than anyone else, does it. The good teams, mediocre teams, and bad teams all do it. Florida just does it in a way that is so ruthless and efficient that you can’t help but notice what it signifies about how college sports are changing. Florida’s best player, guard Walter Clayton, played two years at Iona before the Gators plucked him ahead of last season. Guard Alijah Martin spent four years at Florida Atlantic before joining UF this year. Wing Will Richard, the leading scorer on Monday, started his college career at Belmont before hopping to Gainesville for the last three years.

All of that is very good, actually. Clayton is a superstar, one of the best college guards in a long time, and it is a good thing that his talents have allowed him to choose his landing spot and collect serious money (how much, we don’t know) during his time in college. Martin played an entire career at FAU, and it is a good thing that he was able to spend a year with the Gators, where he had the chance to earn more than he could have ever made playing for an American Athletic Conference school. College sports is a better place because these players had the chance to play out their careers at Florida and win it all. A few of them watched their coaches leave for other jobs, and it’s only right that they could leave too.

March Madness, however, is not “college sports.” March Madness is a three-week tournament that got its nickname because of its propensity to deliver several huge upsets every year. March Madness is an entertainment product where I want to be fed popcorn. And the merciless approach of the Gators, and other teams like them, is threatening all of our popcorn supply for future NCAA Tournaments.

This was a chalky tournament, not just with the one-seeds all making it to the Final Four (for just the second time ever) but with only the mildest upsets even cropping up on the opening weekend. The lowest-seeded team in the Sweet 16 was Arkansas, a No. 10 from the dominant SEC. I don’t think we’ve seen enough yet to conclude for sure that mid-majors will never thrive in March again now that their best players can just leave for schools like Florida.

But I have seen enough to put the “Madness” moniker on probation for a little bit. In a year with no serious upsets to speak of, an SEC team won a stacked tournament with players who, in another year, might have been leading fun tournament runs for universities such as Iona and the more recent Cinderella, FAU. This is not a big enough problem to justify going back to restrictive and likely illegal player movement rules, but it is enough to point out that we may be looking at much more boring basketball tournaments for the foreseeable future. Life has tradeoffs.

Why do I take such a hater’s angle in the aftermath of Florida’s championship, an achievement that deserves celebration? Well, I have no choice, because Florida has made a big deal all season about how it does not have a roster packed with five-star high schoolers. With their win over Houston, the Gators became the first team in the modern era, according to 247Sports, to win the championship without a single player who came out of high school in the top 100 of the recruiting rankings.

Golden talked about it on the floor after Florida clinched a Final Four spot: “I don’t care that these guys weren’t highly ranked!” he exclaimed as his players mobbed him. And indeed, they weren’t, but it’s tacky and lampoonable to portray this Florida team as some sort of little engine that could rather than a collection of the best parts from several smaller locomotives that could not afford to keep all of their machinery intact.","Florida is as deserving a national champion as any NCAA competition has ever had.

Todd Golden was able to move on, and anyone who’d like to ignore the allegations against him will be able to do so easily. The next administrative action Florida takes with Todd Golden will be to offer him a huge contract extension. There’s no sense in comparing the respective moralities of anyone in a college basketball game, though. Whatever your view of Todd Golden, it shouldn’t have hinged on whether he won on Monday.

Instead, Florida’s title is a bummer on basketball terms because of what the Gators’ near-perfection represents. Todd Golden and his staff mastered college hoops roster-building, and they did it in such a rich-getting-richer fashion that it calls into question if the NCAA Tournament you used to love is ever coming back. This is not Florida’s problem; in fact, it’s not anyone’s problem, other than the head coaches of mid-major Division I basketball teams. But it would have been a more just outcome if Duke had won the national championship by simply dominating the tournament with future No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg.

Let me explain. Every college basketball team now relies on the transfer portal for talent. Houston, the team that led Florida almost all night on Monday before frittering the game away, does it. Duke, the program that recruits high school players better than anyone else, does it. The good teams, mediocre teams, and bad teams all do it. Florida just does it in a way that is so ruthless and efficient that you can’t help but notice what it signifies about how college sports are changing. Florida’s best player, guard Clayton, played two years at Iona before the Gators plucked him ahead of last season. Guard Alijah Alijah Martin spent four years at Florida Atlantic before joining UF this year. Wing Will Will Richard, the leading scorer on Monday, started his college career at Belmont before hopping to Gainesville for the last three years.

All of that is very good, actually. Clayton is a superstar, one of the best college guards in a long time, and it is a good thing that his talents have allowed him to choose his landing spot and collect serious money (how much, we don’t know) during his time in college. Alijah Martin played an entire career at FAU, and it is a good thing that he was able to spend a year with the Gators, where he had the chance to earn more than he could have ever made playing for an American Athletic Conference school. College sports is a better place because these players had the chance to play out their careers at Florida and win it all. A few of them watched their coaches leave for other jobs, and it’s only right that they could leave too.

March Madness, however, is not “college sports.” March Madness is a three-week tournament that got its nickname because of its propensity to deliver several huge upsets every year. March Madness is an entertainment product where I want to be fed popcorn. And the merciless approach of the Gators, and other teams like them, is threatening all of our popcorn supply for future NCAA Tournaments.

This was a chalky tournament, not just with the one-seeds all making it to the Final Four (for just the second time ever) but with only the mildest upsets even cropping up on the opening weekend. The lowest-seeded team in the Sweet 16 was Arkansas, a No. 10 from the dominant SEC. I don’t think we’ve seen enough yet to conclude for sure that mid-majors will never thrive in March again now that their best players can just leave for schools like Florida.

But I have seen enough to put the “Madness” moniker on probation for a little bit. In a year with no serious upsets to speak of, an SEC team won a stacked tournament with players who, in another year, might have been leading fun tournament runs for universities such as Iona and the more recent Cinderella, FAU. This is not a big enough problem to justify going back to restrictive and likely illegal player movement rules, but it is enough to point out that we may be looking at much more boring basketball tournaments for the foreseeable future. Life has tradeoffs.

Why do I take such a hater’s angle in the aftermath of Florida’s championship, an achievement that deserves celebration? Well, I have no choice, because Florida has made a big deal all season about how it does not have a roster packed with five-star high schoolers. With their win over Houston, the Gators became the first team in the modern era, according to 247Sports, to win the championship without a single player who came out of high school in the top 100 of the recruiting rankings.

Todd Golden talked about it on the floor after Florida clinched a Final Four spot: “I don’t care that these guys weren’t highly ranked!” he exclaimed as his players mobbed him. And indeed, they weren’t, but it’s tacky and lampoonable to portray this Florida team as some sort of little engine that could rather than a collection of the best parts from several smaller locomotives that could not afford to keep all of their machinery intact."

The Gators' 65-63 win came in a thriller that went down to those final 19 seconds. Houston had one last possession to tie or win the game, but weren't even able to get a shot off against the Gators' stifling defense.

Richard was the Gators' top scorer, with 18 points in the game.

The No. 1-seeded UF team was down by as many as 12 points to Houston, but Richard said he and his teammates never doubted they could win.

""We were all confident. I feel like that just goes back to show how connected we are. ... We have a chance to win a game no matter what the situation is,"" he said. ""We were poised, calm and collected during that time and rallied back.""

Florida and Walter Clayton Jr. somehow overcame Houston's spirit-crushing defense Monday night in an NCAA title-game thriller not decided until Clayton's own defense stopped the Cougars from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.

Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he'll be remembered for most was getting Houston's Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning 3 in the final seconds.

Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for traveling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero. The Cougars and coach Kelvin Sampson were denied their first championship.

Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, winning their third overall title and first since the back-to-back championships of 2006 and 2007.

""Yeah, it's special. I feel like that's why everyone in our locker room came to Florida, just to bring Florida back to that national relevance and bring back a national championship to Gainesville. So it's special,"" Richard said in an interview on ""CBS Mornings"" Tuesday, adding that he didn't sleep at all after the big win: ""We had to enjoy and soak it all in!""

This was a defensive brawl, and for most of the night, Clayton got the worst of it.

He was 0 for 4 from the field without a point through the first half. He didn't score until 14:57 remained in the game. He finished with one 3-pointer and, before that, a pair of three-point plays that kept the Gators in striking range.

But it was Florida's defense, not Houston's, that controlled the final minute.

After Alijah Martin made two free throws to put Florida ahead 64-63 — its first lead since 8-6 — the Gators lured Sharp into a triple-team in the corner, where Richard got him to dribble the ball off his leg and out of bounds.

Florida made one free throw on the next possession and that set up the finale. The ball first went to L.J. Cryer — who led the Cougars with 19 points. Blanketed by Richard, he threw to Sharp, who was moving to spot up for a 3 when Clayton ran at him. That left him with no choice but to let the ball go.

Sampson, who designed a defense that held Florida under 70 points for only the second time this season, looked on in shock.

Instead of the 69-year-old becoming the oldest coach to win the title, the 39-year-old Golden becomes the youngest since N.C. State's Jim Valvano in 1983 to win it all.

The Gators trailed by 12 points early in the second half, and Clayton wasn't the only one getting frustrated.

The Florida bench got a technical during a quick span of three foul calls in less than a minute. Later in the second half, Houston's smothering defense baited Rueben Chinyelu into a technical after committing a foul.

But that wasn't enough. Houston ends up at the same place as the Phi Slama Jama teams of the 1980s — in second place, but memorable.

This gut-wrenching loss came two nights after the Cougars fashioned a wild comeback of their own, from 14 down against Duke.

Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson, 69, was trying to win his 800th career game and become the oldest coach ever to win a men’s basketball title. Instead, he was left frozen after the final possession gone wrong, and it was 39-year-old Gators coach Todd Golden who sprinted onto the floor under a flood of confetti after the final buzzer.

The back-and-forth comeback capped a tournament that had delivered few surprises during its first two weeks, as all four No. 1 seeds advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 2008 and only the second time since the tournament expanded in 1985. The favorites may have prevailed, yet rarely in straightforward fashion, after Houston and Florida required dramatic comebacks in the semifinals against Duke and Auburn to even make it to Monday night's title game.

Clutch Gators guard Clayton scored all 11 of his points in the second half and added seven assists, five rebounds and the title-sealing defensive closeout with seconds remaining. Teammate Will Richard kept Florida in the game during the team’s early struggles, with his 14 points accounting for half of the Gators’ halftime total.

L.J. Cryer scored 19 points to lead Houston, whose 18-game winning streak ended.

Though the teams’ season averages and tournament performances indicated Florida had the more explosive offense, Houston raced ahead to a 29-21 lead within 15 minutes as mistakes cost the Gators multiple scoring opportunities. Yet despite nine turnovers and only the second scoreless first half all season by Clayton, Florida trailed only 31-28 at halftime in the lowest-scoring first half of a championship game since 2011.

The position was familiar for Florida, which had prevailed previously in the tournament despite trailing by six in the tournament’s round of 32, by 10 in the Elite Eight and by nine in Saturday’s semifinal.

That resiliency was tested again quickly. With 16 minutes to play in the second half, Houston took its largest lead, at 42-30, as Florida endured a scoreless drought of nearly three minutes. Yet Florida scored eight unanswered points to cut into the lead, 45-42, with 12:06 left.

Four minutes later, Florida forced a tie after Clayton scooped in a left-handed layup for his first field goal, then added a free throw after being fouled.

Clayton leveled the score again at 60 with less than three minutes to play when he made his first 3-pointer of the night on his sixth attempt — the 11th tie of the game.

At last, Florida took the lead with 46 seconds to play after free throws by Alijah Martin pushed it ahead 64-63.

Florida guard Walter Clayton Jr. sprinted as fast as he could. This was it. The national title was on the line.

Houston guard Emanuel Sharp, the man Clayton was guarding, had run from the left block under the basket and caught the ball beyond the 3-point line at the top of the key. About five seconds remained in Monday night’s NCAA men’s basketball championship game in San Antonio. Sharp jumped up to take the shot, but here came Clayton Jr., closing out on Sharp and extending his left arm. The hustle play rattled Sharp.

Instead of shooting, Sharp pulled the ball back, but because he had left the ground he knew he couldn’t touch the ball or it would have been a double dribble. And so, the ball just laid on the floor before Florida’s Alex Condon dove on it near midcourt as time expired, clinching the Gators’ 65-63 victory. Florida overcame a 12-point second half deficit to win the program’s third national title.

“We work on it in practice, closing out, jumping to the side so you don’t foul the shooter,” Clayton Jr. said. “He pump faked, threw the ball down. (It) ended up being a good play.”

Florida coach Todd Golden was more effusive, calling it an “amazing play.”

“When Condo got on the floor, I figured it was either going to be a jump ball or we were going to come away with it,” Golden said. “Next thing I knew, game was over. Just an incredible moment and something I won’t forget.”

Clayton Jr. won the Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player award, scoring all 11 of his points in the second half, having a game-high seven assists and capping a sensational senior season. He was named a first team Associated Press All-American and averaged more than 24 points per game in the NCAA tournament entering Monday, including scoring a career-high 34 points in Saturday’s 79-73 victory over Auburn in the Final Four.

Still, Clayton Jr. struggled for much of Monday’s game. He was held scoreless in the first half, going 0 for 4 from the field, with all of his attempts coming on 3-pointers. Clayton Jr. couldn’t shake an aggressive Houston team that routinely double-teamed him. The Cougars showed why they entered the game first in analyst Ken Pomeroy’s adjusted defensive efficiency metric and allowed just 58.5 points per game, the lowest average in Division 1.

Clayton Jr. finally scored when he made two free throws with 14:57 remaining, cutting Houston’s lead to 42-34. He had his first field goal with 7:54 left when he drove past Houston’s Terrance Arceneaux for a layup, drew a foul and connected on the free throw to tie it at 48-all.

After Florida center Rueben Chinyelu was called for a personal foul and a technical foul for slamming the ball on the court, Houston made 3 of 4 free throws to take a 3-point lead. Clayton Jr. then came down and converted another 3-point play to make it 51-51. Clayton Jr. tied it again at 60 apiece when he made a 3-pointer with 3:14 remaining.

All told, the game was tied 12 times. And after trailing 42-30 early in the second half, Florida went ahead 64-63 on Alijah Martin’s two free throws with 46.5 seconds remaining, the Gators’ first lead since they were up 8-6. Sharp then dribbled off his leg thanks to a reach-in from Florida guard Will Richard. Denzel Aberdeen, a 54% free throw shooter, made 1 of 2 free throws to give Florida a 65-63 lead with 19.7 seconds remaining.

Houston had one last possession, but Florida’s defense came through as Clayton Jr. disrupted Sharp’s shot attempt and Condon’s hustle play made sure the Cougars wouldn’t have another chance.

“My motto (is) we all can go,” said Clayton Jr., who made just 3 of 10 field goals and missed 6 of 7 3-pointers. “I understand that if it ain’t my night, somebody going to pick me up. We understand we all just picking each other up throughout the year, man. We been doing that all year.”

Florida (36-4) snapped Houston’s 18-game winning streak and became the first team this season to defeat the Cougars (35-5) when scoring less than 70 points. The Gators scored their second-fewest points of the season and shot just 40% from the field and 25% on 3’s, but they held the Cougars to 35% from the field (31% in the second half), including 24% (6 of 25) on 3’s.

Midway through the second half, the Gators stopped Houston on nine consecutive possessions over more than four minutes, cutting a 48-42 deficit to a 48-48 tie. And over the final 2 minutes and 5 seconds, Florida forced four turnovers and held Houston scoreless.

“Our defense won us the game tonight,” Golden said.

The victory followed a familiar script. It was the fourth time in six NCAA tournament games that the Gators trailed in the second half. They fell behind two-time reigning national champion Connecticut by six points in the second round, trailed Texas Tech by 10 points in the Elite 8 and were down to Auburn by nine points in the Final Four.

“I feel like it just goes back to how connected we are as a team,” said Richard, who had a team-high 18 points, including 14 in the second half. “I feel like we all don’t have any quit…I just like our resiliency and how we fight through adversity throughout the game.”

Said Condon: “We got together in the huddle at one point when we were down (and) said we’re good. No one is really stressing out too bad. We just have a lot of confidence in each other, knowing that our shot was going to fall down the stretch.”

On Monday night, Florida led for just 1 minute and 4 seconds, but it was enough to win its 12th consecutive game and 18 of the final 19. During that stretch, the Gators defeated seven teams that were ranked in the Associated Press top 25 poll entering the tournament, including No. 2 Houston, No. 4 Auburn, No. 7 Alabama (twice), No. 9 Texas Tech and No. 11 Maryland.

Florida tied the school record with 36 victories, the same as in 2014 when the Gators lost in the Final Four and more than the 2006 and 2007 national champions that had a future Hall of Fame coach in Billy Donovan and three players (Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer) that were top 10 NBA draft picks. These Gators may not have the star power of the previous NCAA title teams, although Golden, 39, became the youngest coach since North Carolina State’s Jim Valvano in 1983 to win a national title, so he could add more championships in the coming years.

Still, Florida is more than a deserving champion, showing it could compete on the biggest stages all season. The Gators finished second in the regular season in the Southeastern Conference, a league that sent 14 teams to the NCAA tournament and ranks among the best ever. They then won the SEC tournament title and the NCAA title, thanks to their resiliency, never more so than on Monday when it looked like Houston was on its way to winning the program’s first NCAA championship. Instead, the Gators were celebrating at the Alamodome after tying for the third-largest comeback in a national title game.

“They did a great job of never getting too high, never getting too low,” Golden said. “When we went down 12 in the second half, we stayed the course. We didn’t point fingers, didn't start to try to make hero plays, gambling defensively. We got rewarded because of that toughness that we displayed.”","SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS - APRIL 07: Clayton Jr.. #1 of the Florida Gators celebrate a win during ...

Florida guard Clayton Jr.. sprinted as fast as he could. This was it. The national title was on the line.

Houston guard Emanuel Sharp, the man Clayton was guarding, had run from the left block under the basket and caught the ball beyond the 3-point line at the top of the key. About five seconds remained in Monday night’s NCAA men’s basketball championship game in San Antonio. Sharp jumped up to take the shot, but here came Clayton Jr., closing out on Sharp and extending his left arm. The hustle play rattled Sharp.

Instead of shooting, Sharp pulled the ball back, but because he had left the ground he knew he couldn’t touch the ball or it would have been a double dribble. And so, the ball just laid on the floor before Florida’s Alex Alex Condon dove on it near midcourt as time expired, clinching the Gators’ 65-63 victory. Florida overcame a 12-point second half deficit to win the program’s third national title.

“We work on it in practice, closing out, jumping to the side so you don’t foul the shooter,” Clayton Jr. said. “He pump faked, threw the ball down. (It) ended up being a good play.”

Florida coach Todd Todd Golden was more effusive, calling it an “amazing play.”

“When Condo got on the floor, I figured it was either going to be a jump ball or we were going to come away with it,” Todd Golden said. “Next thing I knew, game was over. Just an incredible moment and something I won’t forget.”

Clayton Jr. won the Final Four’s Most Outstanding Player award, scoring all 11 of his points in the second half, having a game-high seven assists and capping a sensational senior season. He was named a first team Associated Press All-American and averaged more than 24 points per game in the NCAA tournament entering Monday, including scoring a career-high 34 points in Saturday’s 79-73 victory over Auburn in the Final Four.

Still, Clayton Jr. struggled for much of Monday’s game. He was held scoreless in the first half, going 0 for 4 from the field, with all of his attempts coming on 3-pointers. Clayton Jr. couldn’t shake an aggressive Houston team that routinely double-teamed him. The Cougars showed why they entered the game first in analyst Ken Pomeroy’s adjusted defensive efficiency metric and allowed just 58.5 points per game, the lowest average in Division 1.

Clayton Jr. finally scored when he made two free throws with 14:57 remaining, cutting Houston’s lead to 42-34. He had his first field goal with 7:54 left when he drove past Houston’s Terrance Arceneaux for a layup, drew a foul and connected on the free throw to tie it at 48-all.

After Florida center Rueben Chinyelu was called for a personal foul and a technical foul for slamming the ball on the court, Houston made 3 of 4 free throws to take a 3-point lead. Clayton Jr. then came down and converted another 3-point play to make it 51-51. Clayton Jr. tied it again at 60 apiece when he made a 3-pointer with 3:14 remaining.

All told, the game was tied 12 times. And after trailing 42-30 early in the second half, Florida went ahead 64-63 on Alijah Alijah Martin’s two free throws with 46.5 seconds remaining, the Gators’ first lead since they were up 8-6. Sharp then dribbled off his leg thanks to a reach-in from Florida guard Will Will Richard. Denzel Aberdeen, a 54% free throw shooter, made 1 of 2 free throws to give Florida a 65-63 lead with 19.7 seconds remaining.

Houston had one last possession, but Florida’s defense came through as Clayton Jr. disrupted Sharp’s shot attempt and Alex Condon’s hustle play made sure the Cougars wouldn’t have another chance.

“My motto (is) we all can go,” said Clayton Jr., who made just 3 of 10 field goals and missed 6 of 7 3-pointers. “I understand that if it ain’t my night, somebody going to pick me up. We understand we all just picking each other up throughout the year, man. We been doing that all year.”

Florida (36-4) snapped Houston’s 18-game winning streak and became the first team this season to defeat the Cougars (35-5) when scoring less than 70 points. The Gators scored their second-fewest points of the season and shot just 40% from the field and 25% on 3’s, but they held the Cougars to 35% from the field (31% in the second half), including 24% (6 of 25) on 3’s.

Midway through the second half, the Gators stopped Houston on nine consecutive possessions over more than four minutes, cutting a 48-42 deficit to a 48-48 tie. And over the final 2 minutes and 5 seconds, Florida forced four turnovers and held Houston scoreless.

“Our defense won us the game tonight,” Todd Golden said.

The victory followed a familiar script. It was the fourth time in six NCAA tournament games that the Gators trailed in the second half.

Florida is No. 1 in the final Associated Press Top 25 men’s college basketball poll of the 2024-25 season after winning the national championship.

The Gators (36-4) received all 61 first-place votes Tuesday, the second year the AP has released its last poll after the completion of the NCAA Tournament. Todd Golden’s team beat Houston 65-63 on Monday night to clinch the program’s third national title and first since Billy Donovan’s repeat titles in 2006 and 2007.

The win also lifted Florida to the top spot in the poll for the first time since the last four polls of the 2013-14 season.

“Obviously we have an incredibly talented group, one of the most talented groups individually in America,” Golden said after the title-clinching win. “I do think what separates us and has separated us all season long is our team talent, how our guys have played together and for each other all year. Because of that, we can call each other national champions for the rest of our lives.”

Houston (35-5) remained at No. 2 after its first title-game appearance since 1984, capping a season that saw Kelvin Sampson’s Cougars reach the Final Four for the second time in five seasons and beat Duke (35-4) in the national semifinals with a shocking late comeback.

The Blue Devils — who were No. 1 in the last two polls before March Madness — were third in what amounted to a swap with the Gators as the only change to the top quartet. Auburn (32-6) stayed at No. 4 after falling to Florida in the Alamodome, rounding out only the second all-chalk Final Four of 1-seeds since seeding began in 1979.

The top tier

Tennessee was fifth and Alabama sixth, joining Florida and Auburn as the headliners for the Southeastern Conference in a year in which the league regularly had the most AP Top 25 teams on the way to earning a record 14 tournament bids.

Michigan State was next at No. 7, followed by Texas Tech, which had Florida on the brink of defeat in the Elite Eight before Gators star Walter Clayton Jr. sparked a wild comeback. A Big Ten duo of Maryland and Michigan rounded out the top 10.

Climbing into set position

Purdue had the biggest jump, rising eight spots to No. 14 after a Sweet 16 loss to Houston on a last-second basket on a perfectly executed inbounds play. No. 12 Kentucky and No. 15 Arizona were next, each rising six spots after their own runs to the tournament’s second week.

In all, 12 teams moved up from the pre-tournament poll into their final position.

One last slide

Louisville had the biggest tumble, falling 11 spots to No. 21 after the Cardinals entered March Madness ranked 10th but received only an 8-seed and suffered a first-round loss to Creighton. Fellow Atlantic Coast Conference program Clemson was next with a 10-spot tumble to No. 22 after a first-round loss to 12th-seeded McNeese.

No. 25 Memphis fell nine spots after being shorthanded in a loss to 12th-seeded Colorado State, while No. 11 St. John’s fell six spots after shooting 28% in its second-round loss to Arkansas.

In all, eight teams fell from the pre-tournament poll.

Comings and goings

John Calipari’s Arkansas Razorbacks checked in at No. 20 after reaching the Sweet 16, joining No. 18 Ole Miss as the final poll’s two additions. Like Arkansas, the Rebels upended a higher-seeded team (Iowa State) to reach the second weekend. Both were ranked previously this season.

Missouri (No. 23) and Oregon (No. 25) fell out from the pre-tournament poll.

Conference watch

The SEC led the way with eight ranked teams, a haul that included No. 19 Texas A&M. The Big 12 and Big Ten were next with five ranked teams each, followed by the ACC with three. The West Coast Conference had two and the American Athletic Conference and Big East each had one.

The final tally

Florida’s rise to No. 1 meant five different teams held the top spot of the AP Top 25 this season, starting with Kansas for the preseason and the first four weeks of the regular season. Tennessee followed for five weeks, then Auburn for eight and finally Duke for the last two pre-tournament polls. In all, 50 teams spent at least one week in the poll this season.

In a game that went down to the wire, the Gators pulled off one of the greatest comebacks in championship history.

CBN News spoke with some of the players who are keeping the thrill of victory in perspective.

In the first half, Florida was down by six points early in the game, but Will Richard sank a three-pointer from the corner to make it a three-point game at 16 to 13. Then Richard kept showing up, making it a two-point game before tying the score at 21.

The Gators would go to halftime down three points.

In the second half, with the Gators down by one, Alijah Martin drove to the basket but got fouled. He hit both of his free throws to give his team the lead. Houston still had one last chance, but couldn't pull it off before the clock ran out and the Gators won the national championship 65 to 63.

By the end, Florida had overcome a 12-point deficit for the third-largest comeback in NCAA title game history.

After the game, CBN News caught up with some thankful Gators.

Will Richard had told this reporter earlier that he listens to worship music and prays with his mom pregame.

""Gotta have it every game. That's who I lean on. All glory to God. I mean, I just wanna make plays, help my team win. Oh, we knew we needed Him in again like this. It is a comfort knowing that He's there with you out there in moments like this,"" Richard said.

""We know all glory belongs to God. He's a faithful God. He's the author and finisher of our faith. And He said it, and we believe it. And we're just so blessed, we lift Him up. It's all God. Nobody but God. Who else can do it?"" Will Richard's mother told us.

Gator Micah Handlogten, who reportedly chose #3 for his jersey to represent the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, told CBN Sports, ""I'm so thankful to God right now and throughout the entire course of the game. Like even when there was two minutes left, we were down three. Me and my best friend Isaiah got together and we started praying right next to the court, just for just peace of mind. Of course, your head's racing a thousand miles an hour at that point in the game, and you just want to calm down, just experience it. So we prayed for it, for peace of mind and ultimately I don't know man, it just feels so good to come out on top and win this game.""

Isaiah Brown, #20, said, ""Last 30 seconds, me and Micah got together. We prayed one more time and we wouldn't be here without him. I want to give all glory to Him.

NCAA Basketball,Daily mail,Right,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-basketball/article-14581987/Florida-wins-March-Madness-national-championship.html,N,"The Southeastern Conference had been, by far, the best group of college basketball teams this season.

This March, they broke the record for the most teams sent to the Big Dance with 14. Seven of those teams made the Sweet 16. There was an all-SEC matchup in the Final Four.

So it's only fitting that the national champions in 2025 hailed from the SEC. As they say down South, it just means more.

For the third time in school history, the Florida Gators have won the national championship - defeating the Houston Cougars 65-63 in San Antonio.

The Gators won this game the same way they won many others in this tournament: off a comeback. After being down double-digits to Auburn in the Final Four, they were down 12 to the Cougars early in the second half.

But to win, they engineered the third-largest comeback in national championship history, tied with Kentucky in 1998. Now, they've captured glory for the first time since Billy Donovan clinched back-to-back titles in 2007.

Houston coach Kelvin Sampson walks off the floor after losing the national title game

Todd Golden became the second-youngest coach to win a national title in NCAA history, only being two years older than Jim Valvano was when he won the 1983 title with NC State. Incidentally, both Valvano and Golden beat Houston to win their titles.

Houston is now 0-3 in national championship games. They couldn't get it done in the 'Phi Slamma Jamma' days with Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon in 1983 and 1984. Now, they taste defeat on the sport's biggest stage once again.

In a season where the four best teams in the sport stayed clearly at the top, it ended with two of those teams squaring off in the final game for a national title.

And dear lord did it look ugly.

Neither team shot 40 percent from the field (Florida 39.6 percent, Houston 34.8 percent). Neither team shot better than 25 percent from 3-point range (UF 25 percent, UH 24 percent).

So at the end of the day, it all came down to who made mistakes. This time, it wasn't the number of errors, but the timing of them.

Four turnovers in the final two minutes - including back-to-back turnovers on the final two possessions from Houston's Emanuel Sharp - doomed the Cougars. Houston didn't score a single point after hitting a free throw with 2:05 remaining in the game.

Florida was led by guard Will Richard, who finished the night shooting 50 percent and racking up 18 points, eight rebounds, and two assists.

The Gators were led by Will Richard (center) who dropped 18 points and eight rebounds

His teammate, Walter Clayton Jr., was named Final Four Most Outstanding Player despite having a sub-par shooting night. Clayton hit 30 percent of his shots, but finished with a statline of 11 points, five rebounds, and seven assists.

Gators big-man Alex Condon also was a key contributor on the evening with 12 points and seven rebounds.

Houston, on the other hand, was led by their star guard LJ Cryer - who was the only double-digit scorer on the Cougars with 19 points and six rebounds.

Shooting 6-for-18 on the night, Cryer was the only Houston player to hit more than four attempts.

Cryer was one of two Houston mentions on the All-Tournament Team. The other was J'Wan Roberts who, after a strong Final Four performance against Duke, only shot 3-of-13 from the floor for eight points and eight rebounds.

Houston led 31-28 at halftime off a quiet start from Clayton, who didn’t hit a single shot in the first half.

Neither team started off shooting the ball particularly well as the nerves of the moment began to take hold in the opening minutes of the game.

But by the time the half came, it was a strong performance from the Gators’ Richard that kept Florida in the game.

Houston was led by guard LJ Cryer and his 19 points and six rebounds on the evening

But Cryer was the only Houston player to get double-digit points as the Cougars struggled

The Cougars opened the second half on an 11-2 run by the time the horn sounded for the under-16 media timeout to take their 12 point advantage.

At that point, Florida hadn’t been taking care of the ball and weren’t hitting any shots. Early in the second half, the Gators’ bench was hit with a technical foul after they jumped up screaming for a foul call on Houston’s Joseph Tugler.

Clayton’s first points of the night came from the free-throw line as Florida struggled to slow the Cougars’ offense down.

Down 10 points, and in spite of Clayton’s struggles, the Gators began to come alive. Denzel Aberdeen, Alijah Martin, and Thomas Haugh all combined for a 7-0 run to cut the deficit to four points and forcing Houston coach Kelvin Sampson to call a timeout at 12:06.

Midway through the game, both teams were facing foul issues. Houston got into the bonus quickly, but Florida was in the double-bonus before the eight minute mark. Not only that, but Cougars forwards Joseph Tugler and Ja’Vier Francis each picked up four fouls just past the halfway mark.

Clayton truly arrived just before the under-eight media timeout. He drove the lane and put up a prayer of a layup that went in as the guard drew contact.

His shot from the free-throw line tied the game at 48. At that point, Houston had gone over four minutes without scoring. They finally broke their drought with a pair of Cryer free throws at the 7:13 mark.

Then, the flood gates opened. Both teams went on huge scoring runs going into the final media timeout.

Coming out of it, Clayton drilled his only triple of the night to tie the game at 60. Cryer hit a tip-in layup to go back up two points. It would be the final field goal of the night from either team.

Under a minute remaining, Tugler fouled out after a drive by Martin. Martin, who lost in the Final Four two years ago with Florida Atlantic, hit two free throws to give Florida their first lead (64-63) since 8-6 at the 15:37 mark of the first quarter.

With 46 seconds remaining, Houston held the ball and looked to make a shot to take the lead and then force something out of Florida.

Instead, Sharp drove into three Gators defenders, then dribbled the ball off his knee and out of bounds to give the ball back to Florida with 26 seconds remaining.

A rough inbound from the Gators led to a Houston foul to put Aberdeen at the line. The 70 percent free throw shooter missed his first shot, but made the second to make it 65-63 with 19.7 seconds left and giving Houston one last chance to win the game.

Up the court the Cougars went. Pressure on Cryer forced him to ditch the ball once again to Sharp. Sharp was open from deep. He jumped up with the ball, but seeing the outstretched arms of Clayton… he just let go of it. He didn’t shoot, he didn’t pass, he just… let go of it.

Touching it would have been an automatic turnover for an up-and-down travel, so Sharpe boxed out anyone around him.

Condon dived on the ball and the horn quickly sounded afterwards - crowning the Gators as the national champions in 2025.","The Southeastern Conference had been, by far, the best group of college basketball teams this season.

This March, they broke the record for the most teams sent to the Big Dance with 14. Seven of those teams made the Sweet 16. There was an all-SEC matchup in the Final Four.

So it's only fitting that the national champions in 2025 hailed from the SEC. As they say down South, it just means more.

For the third time in school history, the Florida Gators have won the national championship - defeating the Houston Cougars 65-63 in San Antonio.

The Gators won this game the same way they won many others in this tournament: off a comeback. After being down double-digits to Auburn in the Final Four, they were down 12 to the Cougars early in the second half.

But to win, they engineered the third-largest comeback in national championship history, tied with Kentucky in 1998. Now, they've captured glory for the first time since Billy Donovan clinched back-to-back titles in 2007.

Todd Todd Golden became the second-youngest coach to win a national title in NCAA history, only being two years older than Jim Valvano was when he won the 1983 title with NC State. Incidentally, both Valvano and Todd Golden beat Houston to win their titles.

Houston is now 0-3 in national championship games. They couldn't get it done in the 'Phi Slamma Jamma' days with Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon in 1983 and 1984. Now, they taste defeat on the sport's biggest stage once again.

In a season where the four best teams in the sport stayed clearly at the top, it ended with two of those teams squaring off in the final game for a national title.

And dear lord did it look ugly.

Neither team shot 40 percent from the field (Florida 39.6 percent, Houston 34.8 percent). Neither team shot better than 25 percent from 3-point range (UF 25 percent, UH 24 percent).

So at the end of the day, it all came down to who made mistakes. This time, it wasn't the number of errors, but the timing of them.

Four turnovers in the final two minutes - including back-to-back turnovers on the final two possessions from Houston's Emanuel Sharp - doomed the Cougars. Houston didn't score a single point after hitting a free throw with 2:05 remaining in the game.

Florida was led by guard Will Will Richard, who finished the night shooting 50 percent and racking up 18 points, eight rebounds, and two assists.

His teammate, Clayton Jr.., was named Final Four Most Outstanding Player despite having a sub-par shooting night. Clayton hit 30 percent of his shots, but finished with a statline of 11 points, five rebounds, and seven assists.

Gators big-man Alex Alex Condon also was a key contributor on the evening with 12 points and seven rebounds.

Houston, on the other hand, was led by their star guard LJ Cryer - who was the only double-digit scorer on the Cougars with 19 points and six rebounds.

Shooting 6-for-18 on the night, Cryer was the only Houston player to hit more than four attempts.

Cryer was one of two Houston mentions on the All-Tournament Team. The other was J'Wan Roberts who, after a strong Final Four performance against Duke, only shot 3-of-13 from the floor for eight points and eight rebounds.

Houston led 31-28 at halftime off a quiet start from Clayton, who didn’t hit a single shot in the first half.

Neither team started off shooting the ball particularly well as the nerves of the moment began to take hold in the opening minutes of the game.

But by the time the half came, it was a strong performance from the Gators’ Will Richard that kept Florida in the game.

But Cryer was the only Houston player to get double-digit points as the Cougars struggled

The Cougars opened the second half on an 11-2 run by the time the horn sounded for the under-16 media timeout to take their 12 point advantage.

At that point, Florida hadn’t been taking care of the ball and weren’t hitting any shots. Early in the second half, the Gators’ bench was hit with a technical foul after they jumped up screaming for a foul call on Houston’s Joseph Joseph Tugler.

Clayton’s first points of the night came from the free-throw line as Florida struggled to slow the Cougars’ offense down.

California Wildfire,Jacobin,Left,https://jacobin.com/2025/01/la-fires-insurance-housing-climate,N,"“The city burning is Los Angeles’s deepest image of itself. . . . The wind shows us how close to the edge we are.” This was Joan Didion writing in 1968 on the effect that the Santa Ana winds have had on the psyche and landscape of Southern California. Almost sixty years on, it remains an enduring image of California: a state constantly on the precipice of disaster. The precipice has only gotten closer as climate change has made the winds stronger and the landscape drier.

This year, winds, their power made worse by climate change, have again laid bare the impermanence of life between the San Gabriels and the Pacific. As of January 13, twenty-four people have lost their lives to the fires, and twenty people are still missing. About 180,000 people have been displaced, and about 12,000 structures have been destroyed. Aside from lives and structures, the Palisades and Eaton fires will have long-term consequences for public health. Particulate matter from wildfire smoke can have lasting health implications and contributes to the 100,000 people who die every year from air pollution.

It will, however, only be in the aftermath of these fires that their true toll will emerge. Those whose homes have survived may face substantial insurance claims for damages; those lucky enough to not have lost their homes will have to bear cost of skyrocketing insurance premiums; the uninsured or underinsured will have no homes to return to.

Many survivors will lack the resources to rebuild, let alone move elsewhere, because of the state’s insurance and housing affordability and availability crises. Exclusive urban planning in Los Angeles has long limited the stock of affordable housing. A flood of displaced residents from the Palisades and Eaton fires into the short-term rental market will put further pressure on an already costly housing landscape. While the LA City Council recently voted to increase housing development in already high-density residential suburbs and in areas zoned for commercial use, it did not do so for single-family zones, reinforcing a culture of low-density, exclusive development into the fire-prone suburbs.

The slower, quieter recovery crisis will take root among the residents of Los Angeles who do not live in beachside mansions. While the Palisades fire impacted wealthy households, it also ravaged manufactured homes. Altadena, a historically black and middle-income community, burned in the Eaton fire. As in many crises, media coverage and attention influence the politics of visibility. The communities seen in the eyes of FEMA, post-disaster response teams, and the East Coaster looking at GoFundMes from afar are often the ones that get to rebuild, recover, and stay. In many cases, wildfires displace working- and middle-class residents and replace them with people who can afford to rebuild.

The fires aren’t even fully extinguished in LA, yet residents are already confronting the realities of collapsing insurance markets in the state and across the country. Many articles on the LA fires and insurance coverage point to a particular statistic: months before the Palisades fire, State Farm nonrenewed nearly 70 percent of its policyholders in the Palisades. But it is not just the Pacific Palisades that will be impacted by the current fire, it’s not just Los Angeles, and it’s not just single-family homeowners.

Across the state, multifamily building owners, affordable housing providers, manufactured housing dwellers, and renters will also experience increased financial precarity from this crisis. According to research from the Consumer Federation of America, more than one-third (35 percent) of manufactured homeowners lack home insurance. There are also racial and income inequities as to who is able to afford or obtain home insurance: homeowners of color and homeowners with lower incomes are less likely to be insured. Similar patterns show up across the country.

These are issues central to all the households impacted by the LA fires, but they should also be of concern to households and policymakers across the state and the country. The availability, affordability, and resulting uptake of insurance defines the answers to many questions: Who will have to leave and who gets to stay? Will people who stay build back safer? Why do people live in those risky places to begin with? The insurance market also constrains what housing can be built in California. It affects not only the affordability of homes but also determines whether some homes can be built at all. This is because access to insurance dictates the availability and cost of mortgages, since banks are unlikely to offer mortgages to homes that can’t get insurance. For families burdened with debt, the funds provided by insurance payouts often the only way that, after a disaster like this year’s fires, they can get back on their feet.

Insurance can be thought of as a form of mutual aid, in that it pools risk across a wide population and spreads exposure to different types and levels of risk (and associated losses) across larger geographic areas so that harm from a disaster is more easily absorbed by more people sharing the risk. Because of current reliance on private insurance companies, which prioritize profit over protecting households, insurers have tried to shift away much of the risk that they take on when offering policies.

They do this in various ways, including by shifting more and more risk to policyholders, which takes the form of premium increases and coverage reductions. Research from the Climate and Community Institute that drew on insurance data from 2017 to 2022 shows that insurers have spread risk and increased premiums across many areas of California. This phenomenon has disproportionately burdened lower-income zip codes and prioritized short-term profit seeking by insurers.

The risk shifting also takes the form of placing the burden of risk reduction on policyholders, justified through what economists call “price signaling.” Price signal theory argues that increased rates (and even the availability of coverage) motivate consumers to either move out of harm’s way or pay more for that risk. Yet there are many flaws to this theory.

First, affluence is often blind to risk signaling. Second, price signaling disproportionately burdens lower-income zip codes. Instead of producing a safer outcome for those in lower-income zip codes, price signaling can increase precarity by making it more difficult to live in a certain area. Difficulty living in an area can lead to danger when there is a fundamental push and pull between affording an insurance premium and protecting one’s home through wildfire mitigation measures, which are also expensive.

Price signaling also doesn’t work well in the context of disasters like the LA fires because of its reliance on individualized risk-reduction measures. Home hardening and defensible space — ways of making homes and the surrounding landscape more fire resistant — are often regulated and considered at the parcel level. The ability to access home insurance depends largely on a suite of individual factors and produces an “every-consumer-for-themselves” mentality when insurers limit their coverage in a geographic area to avoid risk pooling and maintain profit margins.

The individualization of risk mitigation runs counter to the very essence of wildfire as a hazard. Wildfire knows no property bounds. It is inherently multijurisdictional, and its effects are felt across communities, across counties, and across states. It requires housing more people in less risky places and investing in community-scale wildfire risk reduction measures.

The reliance on private insurance markets and price signal theory also doesn’t account for the interplay between disaster risk and housing policy. California, a state with a serious housing affordability crisis, has no comprehensive land use or affordable housing policy to ensure adequate affordable housing in less risky areas. Instead, many of the remaining affordable places to live are located in areas more prone to wildfire (known as the wildland-urban interface, or WUI), and policymakers have thus far failed to stand up to a building and real estate lobby that insists on (and benefits) from expanding into the WUI.

Although the state has a semipublic system in place to respond to the insurance availability crisis, the California FAIR Plan, it is an unsustainable stop gap. Research from CCI shows that the FAIR Plan took on more and more policies from 2017 to 2022, while the private insurance market decreased its coverage throughout the state. This phenomenon has resulted in less coverage for consumers, higher costs, and a system teetering on the brink of insolvency. While private insurers limit their geographical footprints, the FAIR Plan has since taken on a high concentration of “risky” zip codes. California’s shifting insurance landscape may force wealthy residents to forgo protection of their homes, which could inadvertently lead to a massive socialization of risk when state and federal disaster relief funds grow in demand. But it could also mean poorer residents are forced out of their homes or cannot rebuild, because they cannot afford a mortgage needed for their insurance premiums.

Rather than prioritize profit, solutions must prioritize safety and affordability as disasters increase in frequency and scale. A dedicated California state housing resilience agency, which would coordinate disaster reduction activities and provide public disaster insurance, is one avenue to help us get there. An entity like this could host public catastrophe risk models, incorporate a diverse financing stream that reflects the mutuality of risk beyond the policyholder, and host a standardized pricing mechanism that ensures affordable and accessible costs for people. This agency could also lead preventative relocation efforts that guard against the production of new risky housing, ensure the construction of green social housing, and build solidarity across state lines. This kind of approach is needed across the country, because while today’s tragic disaster is in California, the next might be in Florida or Colorado or Tennessee.

The path forward is not easy, but just as winds bring change and destruction, they also make it possible to imagine new life. New life requires new systems of care and new ways of relating to each other. Some of us directly experienced the Palisades and Eaton fires, some of us know someone who did, and some of us, hundreds of miles away, will feel the impacts of the fire in an insurance premium notice, delivered in the mail on an inconspicuous Tuesday morning. Impacts of disasters are collectively felt, and it’s only reasonable that looking forward, they should be collectively mitigated.","“The city burning is Los Angeles’s deepest image of itself. . . .

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: We turn now to the wildfires scorching communities across Los Angeles in one of the city’s most destructive firestorms in history. Over 100,000 people have been evacuated, more than 2,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed, and at least five people are dead — a toll that’s expected to rise. One of five fires now burning started Tuesday in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which has now burned some 17,000 acres. The Eaton fire burned more than 10,000 acres. Fires also prompted evacuations in the Hollywood Hills and Studio City. On Wednesday, President Biden pledged assistance from the Department of Defense.

This comes as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and City Council are facing new scrutiny for cutting the fire department’s funding by around 2%, while increasing the police department budget. Nearly 400 incarcerated firefighters are among those deployed to battle the fires. Democracy Now! reached former incarcerated firefighter Amika Mota with the Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition.

AMIKA MOTA: You know, and many of these people are going home tonight to cells, to fire camps. Also, in Malibu, you know, we have a fire camp there that is under threat. We’re really concerned about the folks there. We also know that there’s a youth fire camp in Malibu, so we have a lot of young people facing some pretty terrible conditions. I can also say that we’re really concerned — you know, Karen Bass has ordered an evacuation within a mile of the juvenile hall in Sylmar, where we have a hundred incarcerated young people. So we’re also really thinking about, you know, our currently incarcerated folks that are really vulnerable to these conditions.

AMY GOODMAN: To see our interview with incarcerated firefighters, you can go to democracynow.org.

But right now for more on the unprecedented fires and the role of climate change, we’re joined by two guests. In Dana Point, California, about 50 miles south of L.A., John Vaillant is an award-winning journalist, author of several books, including, most recently, Fire Weather: On the Front Lines of a Burning World, finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. And in Pasadena, we’re joined by Sonali Kolhatkar, who evacuated with her family, her kids and her parents, from the fires, award-winning journalist, author and host of the radio and TV show Rising Up with Sonali. Her forthcoming book, Talking About Abolition: A Police-Free World Is Possible.

We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Sonali, please describe what you have gone through with your family and how you escaped the fires.

SONALI KOLHATKAR: Thank you so much, Amy.

You know, you don’t expect that you’re going to be in the middle of a disaster that captures international attention. And in my sleepy town of North Pasadena — I’m just two blocks from Altadena — that’s precisely what has happened.

We heard the winds rattling in the middle of the night, more ferocious than they’d ever been. We knew that we hadn’t had rain in hundreds of days. And, you know, we have our neighborhood chat group, and people started talking about whether they should up and leave. I have two elderly disabled parents. And I decided that I would evacuate them before the official evacuation notice came. And already the hotels were filling up on Monday night. We luckily had power, but many of our neighbors didn’t. And we’ve been holed up at this hotel. All the hotels are packed. The convention center up the street is packed.

It’s just devastating — 1,100 businesses in Altadena. This community of incredible people has been utterly devastated. The speed, the ferocity with which these winds have blown the fires has been hard to imagine. I went back yesterday to get my father’s medications, because he’s a diabetic and we couldn’t find his meds at the pharmacies, and I just risked it, went home and grabbed the medication. The air was thick with smoke and ash raining down. And all I could think of was this house that I’ve lived in for more than half my life is still standing, but I don’t know if it’s going to be standing tomorrow or the day after. You know, my husband and I, Jim and I, went back there, and we thought, you know, “Should we hose it down?” But then it will take water from the firefighters. The air is so bad right now that I’m sitting in a hotel lobby miles away from the fires and the internal air is hard to breathe, and I’m having to use a mask. It is just unbelievable. I feel like it is a nightmare.

And I have more than 12 people in my — 13 people, and counting, now in my network of friends who have just lost their homes. And I know many more have, that I’m not even aware of, absolutely lost their homes. I saw some of them on Saturday at my birthday party, and now their homes are gone. And I can’t even picture that. And I don’t know if I will have a home tomorrow or the day after, because these winds are not over. They’re dry. They’re rushing through ferociously.

The firefighters are overstretched. There were fire trucks that were speeding past burning homes because they didn’t have enough firefighters to stop and put out the fires there. And so, some people are staying, because they think that if they make a stand, they can save their homes. They’re risking their lives. And it’s a tempting prospect, because your whole life is in your home. What do I do with my parents and my kids if I don’t have a home to go back to tomorrow or the day after? I don’t know. This is — it’s just — it’s mind-blowing. It’s devastating.

And no one’s talking about climate change in the media. No one’s talking about it. And it’s just — you know, it’s frustrating. So, just, if you believe in a god, pray for us.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, John Vaillant, could you respond to these devastating accounts that Sonali has just given us of what’s happening and what she herself and her family have experienced as they’ve had to flee? And talk about this issue, the issue of climate change. You’ve spoken about this concept of wildland-urban interface and why we all have to understand what that means.

JOHN VAILLANT: Yeah. Good morning, Nermeen. And, Sonali, I’m really, really sorry to hear what you’re going through. And this might be cold comfort, but I’ve spent the last eight years studying fires like this and talking to people who have gone through what you’re going through right now, many of whom lost their homes ultimately.

We’re in a situation now, we’re realizing, or L.A. residents are waking up to the fact, that the climate really owns our communities. It owns our landscape. And L.A. County, you know, the most populous urban region in the country, is now literally at the mercy of fire. And it’s at the mercy of climate. And as Sonali said, it’s desperately dry there, and the winds are still blowing, and the winds control these fires. So, despite the fact that California is famous for its devastating fires and has lost thousands and thousands of homes over the past 30 years to major fires just like these, it’s still shocking when it happens to you. I think all of us, human beings, are defended against that possibility even when it’s happening all around us, and in this case, other parts of California. Now it’s L.A. County’s moment to experience this. And nothing really prepares you for the kind of psychic and physical assault of these kinds of fires.

And this notion of the wildland-urban interface, known to firefighters as the WUI, is that place where the wildland, you know, the hills of the San Gabriel Mountains, San Fernando Valley, butt up against the built environment, the places where we live. And increasingly, very powerful fires are coming into cities, into urban spaces, from these wildlands. And the interface is where they meet.

And what is really alarming — and it’s another thing people don’t talk about — is what excellent fuel the modern house is. So, these wildfires are raging through forest, which is natural. Fire is a normal part of the California landscape. But coming into these built environments, houses nowadays, the modern house, has so many petroleum products in it, in terms of vinyl siding and Formica counters and polyurethane stuffing and the rubber tires and the gas tanks in the garage. There are all kinds of explosive petroleum products built into our lives that we don’t even think about. Look at what your shoes are made out of. When they get hot enough, they are explosively flammable. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s true. And if you start looking around at your home, you’ll realize that petroleum and its products are everywhere. And these are really, really flammable.

And in the case of L.A. County right now, the other kind of sort of secret accelerant is humidity. And you’re down close to 0% humidity, which is drier than kindling, drier than a matchstick. And now you have entire communities that are this dry, so the fire has to do very little work to get going. And it’s got these sometimes 50-, 80-mile-an-hour winds fanning — not just fanning the flames, but really turning them into blowtorches, blowing through these communities. It’s devastating energy. Firefighters can’t really fight it. And that’s why you have such a low percentage of containment on these massive fires that have already done colossal damage.

AMY GOODMAN: And yet, John, you have the media — and I’m not just talking Fox, I’m talking about all the networks. They’ll talk about the “perfect storm” that’s going on now, the high winds, extremely dry weather, especially since October. But they won’t talk about climate change. The weather centers should be renamed climate change centers. But this hesitance to link it to the rest of the world and to this global heating that’s happening right now and what it would mean for policy as a new president comes in whose main motto is “drill, baby, drill.”

JOHN VAILLANT: Yeah, there’s a real moral cowardice in evidence at the government level, at the media level. There is no doubt about the hand-in-hand connection between our obsession with fossil fuel burning — which goes back, you know, for 200 years now — and the alterations in the climate in terms of the buildup of heat-trapping CO2 and methane. And were those companies and the governments and banks who enabled them to acknowledge this, they would have to change their business model. And this kind of blind — frankly, suicidal — loyalty to the status quo of keeping fossil fuels preeminent in our energy system is creating an increasingly difficult situation and unlivable situation.

And I think, you know, some billionaires were impacted over the past couple of days, billionaires who encourage these policies. And yet their inclination is to blame the mayor, to blame the governor for conditions that predate either of their administrations. And so, we’re really — what we’re living in right now is an increasingly shrill dissonance between the fact of climate change, the science of climate change — which is well understood by NOAA, by NASA, by many brave meteorologists who are on television and on the radio — and the governments who are serving, really, handmaidens to the petroleum industry and to the investors who are dependent on keeping them in business.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, Sonali, you know, if you could talk about — you’re one of the few journalists who’s insisted on centering the issue of the climate crisis in your reporting. So, if you could talk about that? And also, your assessment of how the city, Los Angeles, has dealt with these devastating fires? The mayor has come under a lot of criticism. There haven’t been enough firefighters, cuts to the fire department. Sonali?

SONALI KOLHATKAR: Yes. Thank you so much. You’re right. The fact that we keep pouring money into enforcing racial capitalism, the fact that we keep pouring money into ensuring that policing is always well funded while fire departments are not, that our resilience, our climate resilience, is not funded, that’s a matter of priorities. It’s something I talk about in my new book, Talking About Abolition. But this is — you know, how we design city budgets is a blueprint for how we want to live. And so, if we’re pouring money into policing and taking money out of firefighting, if we’re pouring money into our tax dollars going to subsidizing oil companies but not enough subsidies to renewable energy, to electric vehicles, to climate adaptability, then we are basically reaping what we sow.

And we have to be connecting these dots, because whenever you hear the sort of media coverage about these disasters, they’re covered as one-offs, as isolated incidents, that “Here’s this devastating fire. You know, we’re praying for you. You’ll survive. Look at the community spirit.” I don’t want to have to just survive. I don’t want to have to rely on community spirit and my neighbors and GoFundMes to figure out where I’m going to be living next. I want my tax dollars to go towards taking care of me, my community, and all of us being together.

So, we need a cultural shift in our country, away from thinking individualistically about the biggest car we can drive and, you know, the ways in which we can protect ourselves without thinking about how we protect our community and how we’re all in this together. So we have to fight for control over our budgets. We have to fight for control over the priorities that we make, pouring them into climate resiliency and adaptation and ending the stranglehold of fossil fuels over our country and our world. We have to change that cultural mindset, and we have to push our politicians to do the right thing. And billionaires cannot — billionaires should not exist.

AMY GOODMAN: We have to leave it there right now, but we will certainly continue to cover all these issues. Sonali, it is hard to wish you a happy birthday, but on your landmark birthday, we’re thinking of you. Sonali Kolhatkar, evacuated host of Rising Up with Sonali, and also John Vaillant, the author of Fire Weather. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.","This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

NERMEEN SHAIKH: We turn now to the wildfires scorching communities across Los Angeles in one of the city’s most destructive firestorms in history. Over 100,000 people have been evacuated, more than 2,000 structures have been damaged or destroyed, and at least five people are dead — a toll that’s expected to rise. One of five fires now burning started Tuesday in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which has now burned some 17,000 acres. The Cal Fire burned more than 10,000 acres. Fires also prompted evacuations in the Hollywood Hills and Studio City. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden pledged assistance from the Department of Defense.

This comes as Los Angeles Mayor Karen Karen Bass and City Council are facing new scrutiny for cutting the fire department’s funding by around 2%, while increasing the police department budget. Nearly 400 incarcerated firefighters are among those deployed to battle the fires. Democracy Now! reached former incarcerated firefighter Amika Mota with the Sister Warriors Freedom Coalition.

California Wildfire,Msnbc,Left,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/los-angeles-wildfires-trump-response-fact-check-rcna186843,N,"When I was a kid, my grandpa used to take me horseback riding in the chaparral around Los Angeles. It was dry and dusty — a landscape out of one of the Westerns filmed nearby, with a kind of austere beauty that grows on you.

As wildfires rage through the area, I'm thinking back on those trips, worrying about the L.A. residents who are facing the destruction of their community and wondering how we can respond to the increasing risk of these natural disasters as climate change worsens.

You know what I'm not thinking about? Fish.

President-elect Donald Trump is, though, so I need to stop those serious thoughts for a little bit and explain why a small endangered fish that lives hundreds of miles away from Los Angeles has nothing to do with any of this.

Trump describes this as Newsom refusing to sign some kind of document that never existed.

In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump blamed California Gov. Gavin Newsom for the wildfires, arguing that his handling of a complex dispute over water rights in the greater San Francisco area somehow either caused the fires or made it harder to fight them. It's just a 123-word post but I count two false statements, two misleading ones and one that is either a profound misunderstanding of his own argument or just garbled wording.

Newsom, Trump wrote, ""refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him"" (false) that would have allowed millions of gallons of water to flow into ""many parts of California"" (false) because he ""wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt"" (misleading) by ""giving it less water"" (pretty sure he means ""more water,"" but let's move on) and now there is ""no water for fire hydrants"" (misleading).

I called Jeffrey Mount, an expert on water policy at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California, and read him the entire post.

""He got nothing right,"" Mount responded.

Without getting into too much detail, here's what did happen, as Mount and other California water experts explained to me. During Trump's first term, his administration sought to divert some of the water coming into a river delta near San Francisco to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, among others. They came up with a plan for the water, which Newsom challenged in court. The Biden administration later negotiated a new plan with California on how to divvy up the water.

This is basic stuff, so the fact that Trump describes this as Newsom refusing to sign some kind of document that never existed should give you a sense of how disengaged he is with his own policy.

As for the smelt, Trump is being disingenuous. The problem is that there's only so much water to go around in California, and even less when you consider its regular droughts. The water coming into the river delta is freshwater, but where it meets the ocean it becomes salty. Newsom, environmentalists and the commercial fishing industry have generally pushed for more freshwater coming downstream not just to protect the smelt, but also to help more valuable fish, such as salmon and steelhead, which spawn there.

This fire was caused by a combination of a drought, extremely high winds and long-ago decisions by planners and developers.

But that's not the only issue. When the river starts running low, either from a drought or from people drawing too much water out of it, the saltwater starts creeping further upstream, Mount explained. As it does, it damages the local plants and wildlife. And if it gets too far upstream, it will eventually spoil the freshwater that's being piped to farmers, nearby towns and other users.

As Mount put it, even if you don't care about the fish, you still need to let some freshwater go downstream or nobody will get anything.

So what about Trump's implication that the renegotiated deal somehow caused the fires or made them harder to fight? Well, remember that Trump wanted more of that water to go to nut and fruit farmers in areas, most of whom support him, and not to the residents of Los Angeles, most of whom don’t. His feud with Newsom isn't really about the area on fire at all.

Regardless, this wildfire was caused by a combination of a drought, extremely high winds and long-ago decisions by planners and developers about how far into the hills to build — not the county's supply of water. It's true that some fire hydrants ran dry as the Palisades Fire burned on, but that's because the county has underinvested in the firefighting infrastructure in the area. In short, they had enough water for fire hydrants, just not enough tanks to hold it.

In the days ahead, there will be a lot of discussion about how to respond to these wildfires. Where should Los Angeles allow homes to be built? How should insurance companies handle the risk of these homes? What more should the county and the state do to prepare to fight them? How can we all find ways to reduce the climate-changing greenhouse gases that make these disasters stronger and more frequent? These are serious questions and serious people will debate them.

Unfortunately, that debate won't include Trump, whose first instinct was to blame his political opponents, raise an irrelevant issue and misinform everyone about the basic facts. And that's a tragedy of its own.","When I was a kid, my grandpa used to take me horseback riding in the chaparral around Los Angeles. It was dry and dusty — a landscape out of one of the Westerns filmed nearby, with a kind of austere beauty that grows on you.

During Trump's first term, his administration sought to divert some of the water coming into a river delta near San Francisco to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, among others. They came up with a plan for the water, which Gavin Newsom challenged in court. The Joe Biden administration later negotiated a new plan with California on how to divvy up the water.

This is basic stuff, so the fact that Trump describes this as Gavin Newsom refusing to sign some kind of document that never existed should give you a sense of how disengaged he is with his own policy.

As for the smelt, Trump is being disingenuous. The problem is that there's only so much water to go around in California, and even less when you consider its regular droughts. The water coming into the river delta is freshwater, but where it meets the ocean it becomes salty. Gavin Newsom, environmentalists and the commercial fishing industry have generally pushed for more freshwater coming downstream not just to protect the smelt, but also to help more valuable fish, such as salmon and steelhead, which spawn there.

This fire was caused by a combination of a drought, extremely high winds and long-ago decisions by planners and developers.

But that's not the only issue. When the river starts running low, either from a drought or from people drawing too much water out of it, the saltwater starts creeping further upstream, Mount explained. As it does, it damages the local plants and wildlife. And if it gets too far upstream, it will eventually spoil the freshwater that's being piped to farmers, nearby towns and other users.

As Mount put it, even if you don't care about the fish, you still need to let some freshwater go downstream or nobody will get anything.

So what about Trump's implication that the renegotiated deal somehow caused the fires or made them harder to fight? Well, remember that Trump wanted more of that water to go to nut and fruit farmers in areas, most of whom support him, and not to the residents of Los Angeles, most of whom don’t. His feud with Gavin Newsom isn't really about the area on fire at all.

Regardless, this wildfire was caused by a combination of a drought, extremely high winds and long-ago decisions by planners and developers about how far into the hills to build — not the county's supply of water. It's true that some fire hydrants ran dry as the Cal Fire burned on, but that's because the county has underinvested in the firefighting infrastructure in the area. In short, they had enough water for fire hydrants, just not enough tanks to hold it.

In the days ahead, there will be a lot of discussion about how to respond to these wildfires. Where should Los Angeles allow homes to be built? How should insurance companies handle the risk of these homes? What more should the county and the state do to prepare to fight them? How can we all find ways to reduce the climate-changing greenhouse gases that make these disasters stronger and more frequent? These are serious questions and serious people will debate them.

Unfortunately, that debate won't include Trump, whose first instinct was to blame his political opponents, raise an irrelevant issue and misinform everyone about the basic facts. And that's a tragedy of its own."

The Eaton and Palisades fires, two of four major wildfires burning through communities in Southern California, exploded to more than 25,000 acres combined and growing — underscoring the fast-moving nature and extreme risk these fires pose to human life. At least five people have died in the Eaton inferno alone.

The Palisades fire has spread to more than 17,200 acres, while the Eaton fire now burns 10,600 acres, more than quintuple its size Wednesday morning.

Authorities have ordered increased evacuations for the impacted neighborhoods and warn of the ""immediate threat to life.""

LA County Sheriff Robert Luna said Wednesday night that a total of 130,000 people had been ordered to evacuate or be ready to evacuate from the two fires.

At least five people have died and more than 1,000 structures have been destroyed, according to LA County officials. A significant number of serious injuries have also been reported, and the largest fires remain at 0% containment.

Residents who fled the areas reported seeing flames swirling across the usually-scenic canyon and mountain views, as they hurried to escape the imminent danger of the blazes.

""As soon as we saw a visible fire, we immediately started going through the neighborhood knocking on doors and getting people out of their houses because we knew it was going to spread extremely rapidly, which turned to be the case,"" Altadena resident Doug Hoffman told KCRW.

""We first started knocking on doors around 6:20 p.m. and by 6:30/6:45, the whole mountain was on fire.""

Anthony Marrone, LA County fire chief, said there is ""a high number of significant injuries to residents who did not evacuate."" He said first responders have been injured too.

Fueled by powerful winds, the largest fires — the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst — continue to expand, while a fourth, Woodley, broke out early Wednesday, straining responders' capability and triggering a cascade of evacuation orders and school closures. On Wednesday evening, LA city fire chief Kristin Crowley said a new fire, the Sunset Fire, had just erupted in the Hollywood Hills.

Marrone and other local officials emphasized the unprecedented nature of this series of fires, which has stressed emergency responders' resources in just its first day.

""LA County, and all 29 fire departments in our county, are not prepared for this type of widespread disaster. There are not enough firefighters in the county to address four fires of this magnitude,"" Marrone said during a media briefing Wednesday morning. ""LA County was prepared for one or two brush fires, but not four,"" especially with the strength of these sustained winds.

Despite strained personnel, firefighting teams battled winds up to 100 mph overnight. The work to blunt the wildfires' fury proved increasingly difficult as fire hydrants in the Pacific Palisades area went dry around 3 a.m.

The CEO of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Janisse Quiñones, says demand for water has been tremendous — ""four times the normal demand."" She said various storage tanks began running out of water, which affected the pressure of the system.

Officials beg residents to follow evacuation orders

Emergency response officials continued to call on residents to prepare for possible evacuations and to heed orders to leave their homes.

They urged residents not to leave their homes unnecessarily and to keep streets clear for emergency crews and evacuees. Smoke clouds are making visibility of more than a mile difficult anyway, said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, LA City Council president, at the media briefing.

An evacuation order signals the fire poses an ""immediate threat to life"" and mandates evacuations, while an evacuation warning carries a ""potential threat to life and/or property"" and suggests that those with pets and livestock, and those who would need more time to evacuate, do so, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, better known as Cal Fire.

Danger posed to neighboring counties and water

The damage already done from the deadly fires has led one leading climate scientist to predict this event could become the most expensive wildfire disaster in U.S. history, according to NPR member station KQED.

""These fires will likely be the costliest in history, not the deadliest, and that is the only silver lining right now,"" said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with UC Agriculture and Natural Resources and UCLA.

The fires has not just threatened homes and businesses, but affected the area's water supply as well. The LA County Department of Water and Power issued a boil water advisory for the Pacific Palisades community after increased demand from firefighters resulted in lowered water pressure in the area.

""When the water pressure lowers, it can lead to bacteria becoming present in the water,"" the department said. The boil water notice may stay in place for two or more days while crews re-pressurize the system and test the water quality, it said.

Meanwhile, the number of residents without power continued to grow Wednesday. More than 1.5 million customers in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura, Riverside and neighboring counties were without power Wednesday afternoon local time, according to poweroutage.us. Firefighting authorities will typically turn off power lines, as a downed line can cause sparks that escalate to flames.

California Wildfire,News nation,Center,https://www.newsnationnow.com/weather/how-la-wildfires-started/,N,"(NewsNation) — Several fast-moving wildfires continue to devastate the Los Angeles area, and investigators are working around the clock to figure out exactly what sparked the ferocious blazes.

Thousands of acres have been scorched as wildfires continue to rip through parts of Los Angeles County. Five people have died, according to Nicole Nishida, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Officials said more than 90,000 residents are under evacuation orders because of the fires, and thousands have been displaced.

Over 12,000 structures have been destroyed in the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires.

What do we know about the start of the LA-area fires?

Little is officially known about how the fires started but the Los Angeles Police Department has confirmed to NewsNation that the Kenneth Fire is now being investigated as an arson case, and one person is in custody.

Threatening homes near Calabasas and Hidden Hills, the Kenneth Fire is just one among five wildfires ravaging LA County.

Investigators believe the fire may have been set on purpose, and it was citizens who helped detain the suspect. LAPD Senior Lead Officer Sean Dinse informed NewsNation’s Brian Entin that one person is in custody.

Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the penalty for the suspected arsonist could be as high as homicide and could result in life in prison.

“Justice will be swift. It will be firm, and the maximum punishment will be sought,” Hochman said on “Banfield.”

A Washington Post analysis found that the Palisades fire started in the area where firefighters had spent hours using helicopters to knock down a blaze six days earlier, raising the possibility that the New Year’s Eve fire was reignited, which can occur in windy conditions.

The Los Angeles Fire Department’s arson investigation team is currently investigating all the fires, Margaret Stewart, Los Angeles Fire Department public information officer, told NewsNation on Thursday.

Online chatter, including from Elon Musk, has circulated speculation that arson could also be the cause of the Sunset fire that sparked in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles, but authorities have not confirmed.

“The cause of the fire will be investigated. Whether that’s arson or not, that is to be determined,” she said. “Our arson investigators are the ones that investigate the cause of the fire. That doesn’t mean that it’s an arson fire, it’s a cause investigation.”

Though it’s unclear what started the fires, it is more clear how they spread so quickly.

Weather conditions determine how much a wildfire grows, according to National Geographic.

Wind, high temperatures and little rainfall can all leave trees and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays a big part, as well, as flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill.

The Los Angeles wildfires are being fueled by what the National Weather Service said could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in over a decade, coupled with a prolonged drought in the area.

“It’s been bone dry from about Santa Barbara southward, only a few sprinkles since last season. So we’re going on 9 to 10 months now without meaningful rain,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, told NewsNation affiliate KTLA.

What is being done to find out the cause of the LA fires?

Stewart said the fire department is employing all resources to stop the fires and determine their cause, but winds have been challenging.

“The wind conditions that we are facing prevented us from being able to use all of our resources in the way that we would aim to use them, specifically our air assets. Since yesterday morning, all of our fast air assets have been working, and we’ve been in 24-hour operations, and so that will continue,” she said.

How long could the fires last?

While some of the five separate fires have been contained, it is still unknown how long the larger ones could last.

The Sunset fire is “under control,” Stewart said, adding that there are no more evacuations in the areas affected.

The Woodley fire, which has burned 30 acres, is “controlled,” and the Lidia Fire was 40% contained by Thursday morning.

But it could be days and even weeks before the monstrous Palisades fire is taken down. As of Wednesday afternoon, the rapidly moving wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area has spread to more than 17,234 acres.","(NewsNation) — Several fast-moving wildfires continue to devastate the Los Angeles area, and investigators are working around the clock to figure out exactly what sparked the ferocious blazes.

“It’s been bone dry from about Santa Barbara southward, only a few sprinkles since last season. So we’re going on 9 to 10 months now without meaningful rain,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, told NewsNation affiliate KTLA.

What is being done to find out the cause of the LA fires?

Stewart said the fire department is employing all resources to stop the fires and determine their cause, but winds have been challenging.

“The wind conditions that we are facing prevented us from being able to use all of our resources in the way that we would aim to use them, specifically our air assets. Since yesterday morning, all of our fast air assets have been working, and we’ve been in 24-hour operations, and so that will continue,” she said.

How long could the fires last?

While some of the five separate fires have been contained, it is still unknown how long the larger ones could last.

The Sunset fire is “under control,” Stewart said, adding that there are no more evacuations in the areas affected.

The Woodley fire, which has burned 30 acres, is “controlled,” and the Lidia Fire was 40% contained by Thursday morning.

But it could be days and even weeks before the monstrous Cal Fire is taken down. As of Wednesday afternoon, the rapidly moving wildfire in the Pacific Palisades area has spread to more than 17,234 acres."

At least 25 people have died in the Los Angeles fires as two major blazes continue to burn across the sprawling US city. Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost ""tens of billions"" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said.

A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Follow live updates

Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather.

There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: Palisades : The first fire to erupt a week ago and the biggest in the region.

What does it mean for a fire to be contained?

Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped.

What caused the fires?

Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires. SCE has vowed to ""review the complaint when it is received"", pointing out that ""the cause of the fire continues to be under investigation"". A spokeswoman added that the company ""remains committed"" to supporting communities affected by the fires. On Friday, SCE said authorities were investigating whether its infrastructure was involved in the ignition of the separate Hurst fire. 'I have nothing to go back to': BBC reporter loses home

What role has climate change played?

Although strong winds and lack of rain are driving the blazes, experts say climate change is altering the background conditions and increasing the likelihood of such fires. Much of the western United States including California experienced a decades-long drought that ended just two years ago, making the region vulnerable. ""Whiplash"" swings between dry and wet periods in recent years created a massive amount of tinder-dry vegetation that was ready to burn. Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires US government research is unequivocal in linking climate change to larger and more severe wildfires in the western US. ""Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States,"" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. Fire season in southern California is generally thought to stretch from May to October - but the Governor Newsom has pointed out earlier that blazes are now a perennial issue. ""There's no fire season,"" he said. ""It's fire year.""

Key Facts

The Palisades Fire and Eaton Fire both broke out on Jan. 7 and grew to more than 23,000 and 14,000 acres, respectively, destroying thousands of structures and leading to more than 100,000 evacuations throughout Los Angeles. Several smaller fires—including the Hurst Fire and Auto Fire, which were both still active as of Tuesday—broke out after the Palisades and Eaton fires, and led to more evacuations. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection shows the causes of all four active fires are still under investigation, leading to unanswered questions about what could have caused some of California’s most destructive wildfires. Anonymous officials involved with the investigation into the origin of the Palisades Fire told the Los Angeles Times it appears to have human origins, though they noted the investigation is ongoing. Investigators are focusing on a “crime scene” area that sits above most of Los Angeles in a neighborhood with rocky bluffs and popular hiking trails as the potential ignition site of the Palisades Fire, The New York Times reported.

Arson

Dominic Choi, the assistant Los Angeles police chief, said Monday officials are investigating every angle and not ruling out arson as the cause of either of the major fires, but he added there is “no definitive determination that it is arson.” The theory has drawn public attention after a spate of arson-related arrests, including one arrest of a man who was allegedly seen lighting a fire near the smaller Kenneth Fire last week—though police later said there wasn’t probable cause to charge him with arson, and they can’t confirm any link between the arrestee and the fires. Some experts are skeptical of the theory. A former battalion chief for the Los Angeles Fire Department told NBC News the area where the Palisades Fire began is “inaccessible, rugged terrain,” that typically wouldn’t draw an arsonist. Experts also told NBC natural causes are a more plausible theory because of the heavy wind conditions: “Most of the time, these fires are not arson … There is no data supporting winds bringing out arsonists,” a former detective with the L.A. County Sheriff’s Office said. The National Interagency Fire Center says arson may account for more than 20% of human-caused wildland fires, but the actual number is unclear as arson fires may be misclassified for some time.

Power Lines And Electric Infrastructure

Multiple residents of Altadena sued Southern California Edison on Monday, alleging the Eaton Fire was started by the company’s electrical equipment. The lawsuits cite eyewitness reports of sparking power lines. The company has pushed back against the theory, saying in a statement Sunday its “analysis shows no interruptions or operational/electrical anomalies in the 12 hours prior to the fire’s reported start time until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.” One of the filed complaints reportedly alleged, “there is clear evidence from video footage, photographs, and witness accounts that the fire was caused by electrical equipment operated by Defendants Edison International and Southern California Edison.” Power infrastructure has been a leading cause of fires in California in the past—with eight of the state’s 20 most destructive fires having power-related causes—and the amount of fires started by equipment has grown recently, The New York Times reported.

Old Embers—or Fireworks

Some experts and residents believe the Palisades Fire may have been started by the remnants of a fire from New Year’s Day that began after fireworks were set off. The Jan. 1 fire broke out in the same place as the Palisades Fire and burned about three to four acres before fire officials said it was contained about five hours later, the Associated Press reported. Michael Gollner, a fire scientist and University of California at Berkeley professor, told The Washington Post “it’s certainly possible that something from that previous fire, within a week, had rekindled and caused the ignition” of the Palisades Fire. A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department confirmed the department does not typically patrol past fire sites for still burning embers. The New York Times notes a number of past major fires were determined to be started by old blazes that officials believed were put out, including the 2023 wildfire in Maui that killed 102 people and a deadly 1991 firestorm in northern California.

Other Human Causes

Cal Fire said 95% of California's past wildfires have been caused by humans, but the agency noted human causes range from intentional arson to accidental situations, like campfires or discarded cigarette butts, CNN reported.

Lightning

Officials were able to rule out lightning as a potential cause for the Palisades or Eaton fires as the area didn’t have stormy weather in the week the fires began, ABC News reported on Jan. 9. Lightning is a common cause of wildfires, though, and led to 174 wildfires in southern California in 2023, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.

How Many Other Fires Were There In Los Angeles?

In addition to four active wildfires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, there were at least four other fires that are now contained, including the Sunset Fire that burned through the Hollywood Hills and Runyon Canyon, the Kenneth Fire in the West Hills Area, the Lidia Fire in the Angeles National Forest and the Woodley Fire.

What To Watch For

More information from investigators. The process to identify the cause of a fire begins with pinpointing the fire’s starting point, then investigators will usually search the scene on their hands and knees looking for clues to what could have started it, which could take days, NBC News reported. If they find evidence it was started by a person, investigators must then determine whether it was intentional arson or accidental negligence, but NBC reported that process could take months or years.

Key Background

Whatever the cause of the fires, experts seem to agree the conditions for the fires to spread easily were worsened by climate change. The California Air Resources Board said the area burned by wildfires in the state has been increasing each year since 1950, and unusually warm temperatures combined with very low precipitation create “conditions for extreme, high severity wildfires that spread rapidly.” Last summer was particularly hot in California and across the West, while there was very little rainfall: The BBC reported downtown Los Angeles has gotten just 0.16 inches of rain since October.

California Wildfire,Fox Business,Lean Right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/california-wildfires-could-cost-insurers-20b-highest-states-history,N,"A new analysis by JPMorgan estimates that the overall economic losses and insured losses caused by the deadly wildfires impacting Southern California are likely to be the most costly in state history.

JPMorgan's insurance analysts released a report on Thursday that looked at the exposure of homeowner's and commercial property insurance lines in light of the wildfires that have devastated communities in the Los Angeles area, including Pacific Palisades and Altadena. At least five people have been killed in the fires and over 2,000 homes, businesses and other structures have been damaged or destroyed.

The report noted that nearly 30,000 acres have been impacted by the fire and nearly 15,000 houses and buildings are considered to be at risk as of Thursday — up from 13,000 as of Wednesday morning. Firefighters have struggled to contain the wildfires, which are being driven by strong Santa Ana winds.

""Expectations of economic losses stemming from the fires have more than doubled since yesterday to closer to $50 billion, and we estimate that insured losses from the event could exceed $20 billion (and even more if the fires are not controlled),"" JPMorgan analysts wrote. ""This would make this event significantly more severe than the 2018 Butte County Camp fires, the highest insured loss wildfires in California's history previously (with insured losses of roughly $10 billion).""

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES PROMPT SCRUTINY OF FEDERAL, STATE RULES HAMPERING MITIGATION EFFORTS

""Insured losses in the Butte Camp fire were close to two-thirds of economic losses (about $15 billion). That event impacted over 150,000 acres and affected over 18,000 houses/buildings,"" the report said.

The 2018 Camp Fire devastated the town of Paradise and several nearby communities and caused 85 fatalities. It was caused by a downed utility transmission line during a high wind event.

CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES: WHAT TO KNOW WHEN FILING AN INSURANCE CLAIM

JPMorgan's report noted that most of the damage and insured losses in the Camp Fire came from personal property losses, which accounted for 86% of the losses compared to 12% for commercial property and 2% from all other lines and auto insurance.

The ongoing wildfires in Southern California are impacting larger population centers than the Camp Fire did, and JPMorgan analysts expect that the insured losses will be higher as a result.

""While the current wildfires haven't affected as much acreage or as many houses/buildings (thus far), more of the damage is concentrated in the affluent Pacific Palisades area, which has high value residential homes (median home price >$3 million versus <$500k in Butte County),"" the analysts wrote.

""Moreover, the fires have not been contained thus far and continue to spread, implying that estimates of potential economic and insured losses are likely to increase.""","A new analysis by JPMorgan estimates that the overall economic losses and insured losses caused by the deadly wildfires impacting Southern California are likely to be the most costly in state history.

JPMorgan's insurance analysts released a report on Thursday that looked at the exposure of homeowner's and commercial property insurance lines in light of the wildfires that have devastated communities in the Los Angeles area, including Pacific Palisades and Altadena. At least five people have been killed in the fires and over 2,000 homes, businesses and other structures have been damaged or destroyed.

The report noted that nearly 30,000 acres have been impacted by the fire and nearly 15,000 houses and buildings are considered to be at risk as of Thursday — up from 13,000 as of Wednesday morning. Firefighters have struggled to contain the wildfires, which are being driven by strong Santa Ana winds.

""Expectations of economic losses stemming from the fires have more than doubled since yesterday to closer to $50 billion, and we estimate that insured losses from the event could exceed $20 billion (and even more if the fires are not controlled),"" JPMorgan analysts wrote. ""This would make this event significantly more severe than the 2018 Butte County Camp fires, the highest insured loss wildfires in California's history previously (with insured losses of roughly $10 billion).""

""Insured losses in the Butte Camp fire were close to two-thirds of economic losses (about $15 billion). That event impacted over 150,000 acres and affected over 18,000 houses/buildings,"" the report said.

The 2018 Camp Fire devastated the town of Paradise and several nearby communities and caused 85 fatalities. It was caused by a downed utility transmission line during a high wind event.

JPMorgan's report noted that most of the damage and insured losses in the Camp Fire came from personal property losses, which accounted for 86% of the losses compared to 12% for commercial property and 2% from all other lines and auto insurance.

The ongoing wildfires in Southern California are impacting larger population centers than the Camp Fire did, and JPMorgan analysts expect that the insured losses will be higher as a result.

A Flammable Landscape

Los Angeles continues to burn.

As of this writing, the Palisades Fire is spread over 23,713 acres and is 22 percent contained. This means that 22 percent of the fire’s perimeter has been controlled by firefighters through containment lines. The Eaton Fire currently stands at 14,117 acres burned at 55 percent containment. Will Rogers State Park is gone. The homes of celebrities Paris Hilton, Mandy Moore, Billy Crystal, and many others are gone. More than 12,000 homes, businesses, and schools have burned, and 25 people have died. AccuWeather has estimated the cost to rebuild at between $250 billion and $275 billion, and it is sure to rise.

Online commenters were quick to blame the byzantine regulatory systems in California for the magnitude of the disaster. While this is often a good heuristic, since California’s bad policies affect so many aspects of life there, the conflagration seems to have been a natural disaster, not a pure policy disaster.

What many may not know about the fires that occur near Los Angeles is that it’s located in the middle of a chaparral shrubland, a type of ecosystem that grows up around rocky Mediterranean-type regions. Unlike the forests or the prairie, fires in the chaparral are infrequent and intensely hot. While the Native Americans in California deliberately set fires to shrubland, they were not trying to maintain the chaparral but to transform it into grasslands for hunting. Southern California could transform itself into grassland, which would have some advantages in fire management, but it would come with the destruction of the chaparral.

While understanding the ecosystem is crucial for long-term planning, the immediate focus is on recovery and rebuilding. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first major action was to suspend the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the California Coastal Act’s permitting system. As he explained on X, these suspensions “will allow victims of the SoCal fires to not get caught up in bureaucratic red tape and quickly rebuild their homes.”

I am glad these suspensions are becoming the norm during natural disasters. Not only do they fast-track rebuilding, but they also hint at the uncomfortable truth of government: Our normal rules actively prevent us from solving urgent problems. But if these rules can be safely suspended during our most challenging moments—when careful oversight should matter most—then it’s time to reevaluate their necessity during calmer times as well.

The unique nature of chaparral.

Los Angeles is dominated by chaparral, a type of scrub that occurs in Mediterranean climates where there is dense, rocky soil. And chaparral is dominated by pyrophytes, the name botanists give to plants that need fire—and smoke, as it has been recently found—to germinate seeds.

Massive, swift, but infrequent conflagrations are common wherever chaparral occurs, which includes parts of California, Oregon, Baja California, Chile, South Africa, and Australia. Chaparral grows in a way that creates an unbroken layer of fuel from the ground all the way up through the vegetation, making intense fires unavoidable. These are called crown fires because they burn through the tops of the plants. This differs from most forest fires, which primarily burn near the ground because of the separation between the forest floor and the tree canopy.

The western part of Los Angeles is uniquely vulnerable to disaster. As the urban theorist Mike Davis wrote in “The Case for Letting Malibu Burn,” this is due to “the uncanny alignment of its coastal canyons with the annual ‘fire winds’ from the north: the notorious Santa Anas.” The shape of the “San Fernando Valley acts as a giant bellows, sometimes fanning the Santa Anas to hurricane velocity as they roar seaward through the narrow canyons and rugged defiles of the Santa Monica Mountains. Add a spark to the dense, dry vegetation on such an occasion and the hillsides will explode in uncontrollable wildfire.”

Infrequent, uncontrollable wildfire is now understood as a key part of the life cycle of chaparral. As Richard W. Halsey of the California Chaparral Institute, and Alexandra D. Syphard of the

Conservation Biology Institute explained in “High-Severity Fire in Chaparral: Cognitive Dissonance in the Shrublands,”

Although counterintuitive, chaparral plant communities are much more resilient to infrequent, high-intensity fires than they are to more frequent, lower-intensity fires (Keeley et al., 2008). If chaparral does not have sufficient time to replenish the soil seed bank, accumulate the biomass necessary to produce fires hot enough to successfully germinate fire-cued seeds, or allow resprouting species time to restore starch supplies in underground lignotubers, a cascading series of events begins that can significantly change or eliminate the plant community. If the fire return interval is less than 10—20 years, biodiversity is reduced and nonnative weeds and grasses typically invade, ultimately type-converting native shrubland to nonnative grassland (Brooks et al., 2004).

So while it is true that Native Americans in Southern California were actively setting fires long before Europeans arrived, it’s likely that they were doing it to eliminate shrubland and help grasses grow so that grassland animals could be hunted on that land. That is to say, Native Californians weren’t maintaining a healthy chaparral.

Fuel build-up is invariably blamed for the occurrence of large chaparral wildfires. One commenter on the Marginal Revolution blog, for example, relayed what he was seeing on local news broadcasts a week ago,

A man who had lost his house made the point that it was his neighbor just below him that created the conditions for both houses and others to burn: the neighbor allowed brush around the neighbor’s house to grow thick and high, creating a fire bomb once the embers hit the brush. The brush didn’t need a controlled burn, it needed a weed whacker or other device to keep it cut.

But researchers are now balking at that idea. Contrary to popular belief, fire suppression like preventing or fighting fires hasn’t disrupted the natural fire patterns in these areas. In fact, fire suppression has actually been helpful because it’s protected the chaparral from burning too frequently, which would be harmful to the ecosystem, which prefers a cycle of 30 years or more. Without fire suppression efforts, human-caused fires would have resulted in the vegetation burning far more often than it did historically. Because fire suppression has helped maintain a more natural fire pattern in the long term, the chaparral was set up to go up in a blaze when the conditions were right. Abnormally strong rains in 2023 drove plant growth, which then became a tinderbox this year with a lack of rain. Unusually strong winds gave it the air to quickly expand. Monday’s The Morning Dispatch did an excellent job of explaining how all of this came together.

While conventional wisdom suggests we need more frequent, controlled burns to prevent disasters, the science of chaparral tells a different story. These ecosystems don’t just tolerate massive conflagrations, they require them for their very survival. The devastation we witnessed wasn’t an aberration or a result of poor fire management. It was the chaparral operating exactly as nature intended, on a timeline measured not in years, but in decades. Understanding this reality is essential for anyone choosing to live in these beautiful but periodically explosive landscapes.

Regulations still stymie controlled burns.

All of this makes controlled burns ill-suited for Southern California’s chaparral. But that isn’t to say that controlled burns aren’t needed elsewhere in other ecosystems in California. And controlled burns are stymied by delays. Like any other government action, controlled burns are subjected to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and CEQA, California’s version of the law.

Environmental groups aren’t fans of controlled burns or thinning efforts and have taken both the state and federal governments to court over them. Activists delayed a 9,000-acre forest thinning project in California for 10 years, citing potential threats to spotted owl habitat. However, the unthinned forest ultimately burned in a wildfire, destroying the very owl habitat they had sought to protect. The Sacramento Bee reported that one woman’s lawsuit over another California forest-thinning project forced the government to process 19,193 pages of paperwork. And to top it off, in 2007, the Sierra Club successfully sued the Forest Service to prevent it from exempting small, controlled burns. In California, it takes months to get approval for a controlled burn, while in Florida it takes mere minutes.

Still, as Kevin Drum wrote in “Why don’t we do more prescribed burning? An explainer.” regulations are part of the problem, but they aren’t the only thing stopping controlled burns:

The biggest impediments are public opposition, rising insurance costs, resource constraints, and the risk-averse views of forest managers, many of whom are still wary of prescribed burns. This is partly for technical reasons and partly out of fear. Only one out of a thousand prescribed burns gets out of control, but that’s enough.

If officials conduct a prescribed burn that gets out of control, they face serious consequences and liability. However, when devastating wildfires destroy communities and landscapes due to long-term neglect of forest management, no one is held accountable for these preventable disasters. The cumulative result is that fewer acres are burned than what experts would want.

What’s next.

Insurers will face pressure as people inevitably rebuild, and something will break.

California’s insurance system requires a public hearing and an affirmative approval by elected insurance commissioners to increase rates. But Proposition 103, which passed in 1988 to reform California’s insurance regulations, is unique in that it allows nonprofit organizations to collect fees when they challenge proposed insurance rate hikes. California’s system is generally viewed as unmatched in terms of the extent to which consumers and advocacy groups can formally intervene in insurance rate filings.

As a result, insurance companies have stopped issuing new policies that cover fire. This, in turn, has put pressure on the state’s insurer of last resort, FAIR. But even FAIR is buckling under all the payouts. For years, the Pacific Palisades has been cited as one of the largest areas of exposure for FAIR at nearly $6 billion. As it last reported, however, FAIR had about $700 million in cash and even though it caps payments at $3 million, it likely will need a bailout.

Still, I think it is telling that Newsom’s immediate policy response was an executive order that suspended CEQA review and California Coastal Act permitting for properties being reconstructed. His executive order didn’t just streamline reconstruction. It laid bare a paradox at the heart of the state’s regulatory framework. By suspending both CEQA review and Coastal Act permitting for rebuilding, while directing agencies to identify other regulations that could be safely relaxed, Newsom tacitly acknowledged what many have long suspected. If these rules can be safely suspended during our most challenging moments when careful oversight should matter most, perhaps it’s time to reevaluate their necessity during calmer times as well.

My former colleague Tahra Jirari made a similar point recently, writing that, “Rather than temporarily waiving them just for rebuilding, we should seize this moment to create a permanently more functional system.” As a Los Angeleno, she’s been in the middle of this disaster, and as an economist, she’s been thinking about how to rebuild better. As she told me, even with the suspension of CEQA and California Coastal Commission rules, “current policies are quite restrictive and will make it difficult to rebuild. All of this has made us more vulnerable than we should be because we need to build densely away from fire-prone zones.”

Many L.A. residents love being near nature and the chaparral, but they don’t understand the risk. Every so often, the region will burn in a hot blaze. This isn’t a failure of policy or prevention. It’s the fundamental nature of this ecosystem. Living in the chaparral means accepting its cycles: long periods of beautiful, rugged wilderness punctuated by devastating fires that can’t be tamed. The question isn’t how to prevent these fires entirely, but how to build and live with the knowledge that they will inevitably return.

Economic losses due to Hurricane Katrina, according to AccuWeather, totaled $320 billion.

AccuWeather’s estimate factors in homes and business damaged, infrastructure damage, costs of rebuilding and relocating people whose homes were destroyed. It also includes cleanup costs, emergency response expenses and immediate and long-term health costs for victims affected by the fires.

The number also considers lost wages and housing displacement for tens of thousands of workers and business owners who were forced to evacuate, which could lead to layoffs and business closures, AccuWeather said.

Wildfires began burning in LA County last Tuesday and quickly exploded out of control as Santa Ana wind gusts of up to 100 mph from the mountains pushed the flames toward the sea.

At least 25 people have died.

The strong winds continued this week — but are expected to change directions this weekend, improving fire conditions and giving firefighters a chance to finally contain the blazes, Fox Weather meteorologist Marissa Lautenbacher told The Post.

Winds on Friday are expected to shift from the east, where dry air has been blowing in from the mountains inland, to the west, bringing in moist air off the Pacific Ocean.

“Because we’re getting the wind flipped from being from more of a drier land mass to more of over the ocean, that brings with it moisture. So essentially the moisture, it’s going to be more and more difficult for any sort of climate fires to start,” she said. “It’s going to be way better for firefighting conditions.”

The largest fire, the Palisades Fire, has burned more than 23,700 acres (37 square miles) and is only 19% contained as of Wednesday morning.

The deadly wildfires, which have torched more than 40,000 acres (62.5 square miles, nearly three times the size of Manhattan Island) and destroyed over 12,000 structures over the last week, is now one of the costliest natural disasters in US history, according to the latest estimate from AccuWeather — as the blazes, fueled by strong winds, continue to burn.

“Hurricane-force winds sent flames ripping through neighborhoods filled with multimillion-dollar homes,” AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Jonathan Porter said. “The devastation left behind is heartbreaking, and the economic toll is staggering.”

“Tragically, lives have been changed forever in just a matter of minutes. Many families may not be able to afford to rebuild or repair and return. Businesses may not be able to recover, and jobs will be permanently lost. Thousands of people are in desperate need of help, initially the basic and life-sustaining needs of food, water and shelter, as this tragedy unfolds,” Jonathan Porter said.

“The recovery process will be extremely expensive and emotionally challenging in the months and years to come,” he added.

The grim calculation eclipses the $210 billion (adjusted for inflation) in estimated damages and economic losses from Superstorm Sandy, which battered New Jersey and New York in 2012, AccuWeather meteorologist Marshall Moss told The Post.

The damage and economic losses of the LA wildfires have also surpassed 2017’s Hurricane Harvey ($230 billion) and 2024’s Hurricane Helene ($225 billion to $250 billion).

California Wildfire,Daily mail,Right,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14271321/LA-fires-key-questions-California-disaster-answered.html,N,"The fast-moving LA fires that's killed 24 and destroyed more than 20,000 acres in the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other areas continue to burn with no end in sight.

Extreme dry weather conditions due to a prolonged drought, dry vegetation and powerful Santa Ana winds that reached up to 80 mph in some areas this week proved to be the 'perfect storm' for the worst fire the area has seen in more than two decades.

Here's what we know:

How did the fires start?

The Palisades Fire - which has destroyed over 21,000 acres as of Friday afternoon - started Tuesday morning in the wealthy Pacific Palisades enclave just east of Malibu.

There are many different theories about what fueled the blaze, with LA Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said she believes the fire was started accidentally in a back garden but quickly 'spread at a speed beyond anything we've seen.'

The fire's ferocity may have also been fueled by multiple faults along the Los Angeles power grid. Power was not immediately shut off as faults soared in areas worst hit by the fires.

Residents who live at North Piedra Morada Drive quickly made the call around 10 am as the hillside fire progresses closer to the multi-million dollar homes that dot the Pacific Palisades hillsides, according to the LA Times.

Videographer Kevin Ray, who was recording planes landing at LAX about 25 miles away from Pacific Palisades, captured one of the earliest footage shot just as the fire erupted about 10:25 a.m. local time.

Ray could be heard in the video saying this was 'not something we want to see here in Southern California' as he panned to the black plume of smoke billowing from the Palisades hillside.

LA and LA County residents who live in high fire hazard zones such as the Palisades are required to clear brush and trim trees around their property.

Fire officials believe the fires started in a back garden, but residents have told DailyMail.com they saw suspicious individuals in the area where smoke was first spotted

LA Mayor Karen Bass, center, is facing mounting criticism for being out of the country as the Palisades fire consumed entire neighborhoods

Nevertheless, many of the homes surrounded by the wildland hillsides quickly went up in flames Tuesday morning as the the strong Santa Ana winds pushed the fire into the more populated area of the seaside enclave.

Palisades residents exclusively told DailyMail.com two men were caught on camera dumping gasoline and setting it on fire just before the deadly Palisades fire broke out.

As the fast-moving fire progressed into neighborhoods and consumed one block after another, fire crews were faced with another problem: fire hydrants had little to no water.

Why did the hydrants run out?

By Tuesday afternoon, one of the LA Department of Water and Power water tanks that service the Palisades area ran out of water, according to Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer.

Three tanks that each hold a capacity of 117 million gallons should maintain enough water pressure that allows water to travel uphill through pipes and to fire hydrants in the neighborhoods.

But water pressure began to decrease because of the heavy water use, LA Department of Water and Power officials said.

The second ran out at approximately 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday and the last tank ran out and 'went dry' at about 3 a.m. Wednesday, according to Janisse Quiñones, LADWP chief executive and chief engineer.

'We had tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades. We pushed the system to the extreme,' Quiñones said during a news conference Wednesday. 'Four time the normal demand was seen for 15 hours straight, which lowered our water pressure.'

Residents evacuated the Pacific Palisades area after receiving alerts on their cell phones. City and county officials have since received criticism after alerts were erroneously sent to residents nowhere near any fires

Janisse Quiñones, LADWP chief executive and chief engineer, said water did not flow freely from fire hydrants die to extreme demand on the system

Sources told DailyMail.com the Sant Ynez Reservoir was actually empty when the Palisades Fire began

However, that the Santa Ynez Reservoir that serves the Palisades area was actually offline and had been closed for repairs at the time when the fire exploded on Tuesday, DailyMail.com has learned.

A source in the LA Fire Department told DailyMail.com that DWP officials told them 'had it not been closed they probably would have been ok and had enough water for the fire.'

Former DWP general manager Martin Adams told the LA Times if the reservoir was operating, it could have extended water pressure that first night.

'Would it have helped? Yes, to some extent,' Adams told the publication. 'Would it have saved the day? I don't think so.'

LA County and LA City officials are facing even further scrutiny after residents pointed to a decision to suspend the annual fire hydrant testing for the 2024-25 fiscal year.

A notice from Dec. 24 showed the fire department was temporarily suspended because of 'fiscal challenges'.

LA Fire sources told DailyMail.com that city-wide fire hydrant testing was supposed to take place last January and usually took three days.

'You have to make sure these hydrants work, and yes, it absolutely would've made a difference in fighting all of these fires,' the source said. 'We've had some issues with hydrants and that 's why it's important to test them annually so we can tell LADWP to fix it. The can't fix it unless they know it's broken, and it was our job to do that but that [testing] was suspended.'

Sources also told DailyMail.com that morale in the LA City and County fire departments are 'at an all-time low' as they faced severe budget cuts.

Why was the budget slashed?

Records show the city's fire department budget was cut more than $17.5 million just seven months before the Palisades fire.

Mayor Laren Bass signed the budget allotting $819.64 million for the fire department. In the previous fiscal year, the fire department's budget was $837.2 million.

In the meantime, the city's police budget increased by $126 million.

In a statement in June, Bass said the cuts was a necessary 'reset'.

'This budget serves as a reset, in part by continuing to hire for critical positions including police officers and firefighters while eliminating some of the departments vacant positions, thereby prioritizing our City family over empty desks,' the mayor said.

Why was Mayor Karen Bass gone during the start of the fires?

Bass faced criticism for being away on an overseas trip to Ghana as the most destructive fire in LA's history ravaged the oceanside enclave.

Bass was in Ghana attending the inauguration of President John Dramani as part of a US presidential delegation, which was announced last month.

During a press conference Thursday, the mayor addressed the backlash and said she was on the phone with various emergency personnel as she made her way back to LA.

'We have to save lives and we have to save homes,' Bass said when asked why the city was ill-prepared for the wildfire. 'Rest assured that when that is done, when we are safe, when lives have been saved and homes have been saved, we will absolutely do an evaluation to look at what worked, what didn't work, and to correct or to hold accountable anybody, department, individual, etc.. But my focus right now is on the lives and on the homes.'

Why were there not more firefighters?

The National Weather Service in LA issued numerous warnings about the dangerous weather conditions days leading up to the deadly Palisades fire.

'This is an event that had exceptionally long lead tomes, not only of the powerful windstorm that we anticipated but also the potential for a particularly dangerous situation, red flag warning, fire weather conditions,' meteorologist Ariel Cohen told CNN.

Firefighters with the LA Fire Department told DailyMail.com they were not asked to mobilize until it was too late

However, sources with the LA Fire Department told DailyMail.com they did not receive a call to 'pre-deploy' until Tuesday morning.

'Usually, when there is a high wind warning, we staff extra fire engines to be ready to go,' the source said. 'There should've been a pre-deploy at least a day before. They didn't do that so we went home.'

Sources added that once many of the firefighters came back, some were once again called off by Wednesday because there was not enough operable rigs.

'It would've made a huge difference, having 30 to 40 more engines they could've have fully staffed. We could've done water shuttles into the fire, but when you don't have the apparatus, you can't do that.'

LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley wrote in a December 4 memo to the Board of Fire Commissioners that the budget cuts 'have adversely affected the Department's ability to maintain core operations.'

She added that the $7 million reduction in overtime hours limited the Department's capacity 'to prepare for, train for and respond to large-scale emergencies'. It also affected the Department's other duties, including inspecting homes for brush clearance inspections on residential homes.

LAFD Chief Kristine Crowley warned added budget cuts to her department's coffers would be detrimental

In a memo obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, Bass demanded an additional $49 million budget cut just a week before the wildfires broke out.

'The LAFD is still going through a FY [financial year] 2024/2025 $48.8million budget reduction exercise with the CAO [City Attorney's Office],' the document said.

'The only way to provide a cost savings would be to close as many as 16 fire stations (not resources, fire stations); this equates to at least one fire station per City Council District.

'The details of this plan have not yet been developed. This is a worst-case scenario and is NOT happening yet.'

Sources said firefighters across the county are fed up.

'We are running a skeleton crew every single day,' a veteran LA City firefighter told DailyMail.com. 'They didn't pre-deploy anybody and they didn't hire because they don't want to spend the money. We can't sustain 2,000 calls a day and successfully fight a wildfire. And no one does a damn thing because they don't give a s--t.'

Why didn't residents get better warnings?

At 10:56 a.m. Tuesday, Bass' office sent out a release announcing all city departments to prepare for the 'anticipated dangerous windstorm'.

Residents received a mandatory evacuation alert on their mobile phones around 12:50 p.m. Tuesday for 'forest fire burning'.

By that time, the brush fire was already surrounding the multimillion dollar homes nestled in the overgrown hillsides.

People rushed to their cars and made their way down Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard, causing gridlock and panic as flames began to surround the narrow two-lane road.

Police hastily told the motorists to abandon their cars and the residents - many who are elderly - struggled to walk down the road.

Workers, caregivers, gardeners and others who provide service to wealthy Palisades residents also were trapped in the gridlock.

Actor Steve Guttenberg was interviewed by local TV station KTLA at 1 p.m. Tuesday and asked those fleeing to leave their keys in the ignition if they abandon their vehicles.

'If anybody has a car, leave the keys in the car so we can move your car so that these firetrucks can get up Palisades Drive,' the Police Academy star said.

Others stayed and tried their best to fight the blaze and save their homes with garden hoses.

By 3 p.m., bulldozers were brought in to push dozens of abandoned cars on Palisades Drive so firetrucks could drive up the hillside where the fire was raging.

By the end of the night, the fire had already consumed hundreds of homes, businesses and other structures. Entire communities once known for posh shops and restaurants and multimillion dollar home were left unrecognizable.

Wind gusts up to 80 mph fanned the already fast-moving flames, burning thousands of acres in hours

As of Friday afternoon, the Palisades Fire has decimated more than 21,000 acres in the Malibu, Pacific Palisades and the Santa Monica Mountain areas

LA city and county officials received further ire after an wireless emergency evacuation alert went out to residents on Thursday despite not being near any of the hot zones.

On Friday morning, LA County officials confirmed the message was sent erroneously.

During a press conference, Kevin McGowan, director of the LA County Office of Emergency Management, addressed the frustration residents felt after receiving the alert.

'First of all I want to clarify this is not human-driven,' McGowan said. 'There is no one sitting at a desk right now initiating emergency alerts. I want to restate that, right now as these alerts are being issued they are not being activated or initiated by a person.'

Which celebrities lost their homes?

Several A-List celebrities who lost their multimillion-dollar homes to the Palisades Fire continue to grow as some have returned to their Pacific Palisades and Malibu Homes.

Hollywood elite such as Anthony Hopkins, Julia -Louis Dreyfus, Jeff Bridges, Eugene Levy, Mel Gibson, Miles Teller, Milo Ventimiglia, Cary Elwes, Paris Hilton, Adam Brody, Candy Spelling and Tina Knowles have revealed they have lost their properties.

Actor and comedian Billy Crystal wrote a heartbreaking statement on their loss.

'Janice and I lived in our home since 1979,' Crystal wrote.

'We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can’t be taken away.

'We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this.'

The deadly Palisades Fire scorched 21,317 acres in the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains as of Friday night. The fire has destroyed more than 5,000 structures with containment at 8%, according to fire officials.

The Palisades Fire has killed at least two people, according to the LA County Department of Medical Examiner.

The Medical Examiner confirmed a total of 11 people have died in fires burning throughout Southern California, including in Altadena and the West Hills area.","The fast-moving LA fires that's killed 24 and destroyed more than 20,000 acres in the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and other areas continue to burn with no end in sight.

'It would've made a huge difference, having 30 to 40 more engines they could've have fully staffed. We could've done water shuttles into the fire, but when you don't have the apparatus, you can't do that.'

LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley wrote in a December 4 memo to the Board of Fire Commissioners that the budget cuts 'have adversely affected the Department's ability to maintain core operations.'

She added that the $7 million reduction in overtime hours limited the Department's capacity 'to prepare for, train for and respond to large-scale emergencies'. It also affected the Department's other duties, including inspecting homes for brush clearance inspections on residential homes.

LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley warned added budget cuts to her department's coffers would be detrimental

In a memo obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, Karen Bass demanded an additional $49 million budget cut just a week before the wildfires broke out.

'The LAFD is still going through a FY [financial year] 2024/2025 $48.8million budget reduction exercise with the CAO [City Attorney's Office],' the document said.

'The only way to provide a cost savings would be to close as many as 16 fire stations (not resources, fire stations); this equates to at least one fire station per City Council District.

'The details of this plan have not yet been developed. This is a worst-case scenario and is NOT happening yet.'

Sources said firefighters across the county are fed up.

'We are running a skeleton crew every single day,' a veteran LA City firefighter told DailyMail.com. 'They didn't pre-deploy anybody and they didn't hire because they don't want to spend the money. We can't sustain 2,000 calls a day and successfully fight a wildfire. And no one does a damn thing because they don't give a s--t.'

Why didn't residents get better warnings?

At 10:56 a.m. Tuesday, Karen Bass' office sent out a release announcing all city departments to prepare for the 'anticipated dangerous windstorm'.

Residents received a mandatory evacuation alert on their mobile phones around 12:50 p.m. Tuesday for 'forest fire burning'.

By that time, the brush fire was already surrounding the multimillion dollar homes nestled in the overgrown hillsides.

People rushed to their cars and made their way down Palisades Drive and Sunset Boulevard, causing gridlock and panic as flames began to surround the narrow two-lane road.

Police hastily told the motorists to abandon their cars and the residents - many who are elderly - struggled to walk down the road.

Workers, caregivers, gardeners and others who provide service to wealthy Palisades residents also were trapped in the gridlock.

Actor Steve Guttenberg was interviewed by local TV station KTLA at 1 p.m. Tuesday and asked those fleeing to leave their keys in the ignition if they abandon their vehicles.

'If anybody has a car, leave the keys in the car so we can move your car so that these firetrucks can get up Palisades Drive,' the Police Academy star said.

Others stayed and tried their best to fight the blaze and save their homes with garden hoses.

By 3 p.m., bulldozers were brought in to push dozens of abandoned cars on Palisades Drive so firetrucks could drive up the hillside where the fire was raging.

By the end of the night, the fire had already consumed hundreds of homes, businesses and other structures. Entire communities once known for posh shops and restaurants and multimillion dollar home were left unrecognizable.

Wind gusts up to 80 mph fanned the already fast-moving flames, burning thousands of acres in hours

As of Friday afternoon, the Cal Fire has decimated more than 21,000 acres in the Malibu, Pacific Palisades and the Santa Monica Mountain areas

LA city and county officials received further ire after an wireless emergency evacuation alert went out to residents on Thursday despite not being near any of the hot zones.

On Friday morning, LA County officials confirmed the message was sent erroneously.

During a press conference, Kevin Kevin McGowan, director of the LA County Office of Emergency Management, addressed the frustration residents felt after receiving the alert.

'First of all I want to clarify this is not human-driven,' Kevin McGowan said. 'There is no one sitting at a desk right now initiating emergency alerts. I want to restate that, right now as these alerts are being issued they are not being activated or initiated by a person.'

Which celebrities lost their homes?

Several A-List celebrities who lost their multimillion-dollar homes to the Cal Fire continue to grow as some have returned to their Pacific Palisades and Malibu Homes.

Hollywood elite such as Anthony Hopkins, Julia -Louis Dreyfus, Jeff Bridges, Eugene Levy, Mel Gibson, Miles Teller, Milo Ventimiglia, Cary Elwes, Paris Hilton, Adam Brody, Candy Spelling and Tina Knowles have revealed they have lost their properties.

Actor and comedian Billy Crystal wrote a heartbreaking statement on their loss.

'Janice and I lived in our home since 1979,' Crystal wrote.

'We raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can’t be taken away.

'We are heartbroken of course but with the love of our children and friends we will get through this.'

The deadly Cal Fire scorched 21,317 acres in the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and the Santa Monica Mountains as of Friday night. The fire has destroyed more than 5,000 structures with containment at 8%, according to fire officials.

The Cal Fire has killed at least two people, according to the LA County Department of Medical Examiner.

The Medical Examiner confirmed a total of 11 people have died in fires burning throughout Southern California, including in Altadena and the West Hills area."
